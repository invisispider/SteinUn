In our culture, individualism         is a given, as our fundamental faith and belief (or myth) is that a person can know reality         through reason, logic, and education. We are typically educated in schools         that teach science, math, history, language, what amounts to a liberal education for          a citizen of a nation, and Orange is more or less expected of us.         Rationality and objectivity have a global,         as opposed to regional, appeal. Orange has moved         into the abstract and cerebral Right Quadrants, and the notion of universal governing principles (the LR)         ought to be compatible with repeated observation (the UR) by qualified individuals (UL) and these         will be validated by a community (LL) of competent peer review. The essential thing to understand         as a rational person reconciling yourself with pre-rational beliefs and superstitions of others, is that until         you are personally developed to Orange, you just don't conceptually "get" the notion of the LR,         and so the idea of proving something true doesn't really mean the same thing to the mythic believer,         who is compelled to accept only those notions which feel morally correct "in the heart," which Amber never did figure out         spreads oxygen and does not think.         It actually takes most of childhood in a quality school to become a genuine rational person capable of         deducing the laws of nature. Amber believers keep their children out of quality schools that         teach rational facts and methodologies that apply to the real world and contradict tradition.         Once you have personally made the turn to a more or less rational Level being, it becomes tough         to comprehend the pre-rational. Integral serves to legitimize the dignity of lower Levels as         well as higher. Orange is far from the top. You have configured yourself, for the first         time, by assembling myths and testing truthiness, into a being that can comprehend universal         abstract patterns, and so you have all four Quadrants fully differentiated.         The best articulation of Orange         can be found in Ayn Rand's philosophical literary fiction, which         also express Orange Shadow quite impressively.         Put it this way, Jack (takes a drag off a cigarette): Orange is not an optimal configuration. It is the first configuration that         allows you to see anything certain at all. Don't cling to that. Do what         you did every time before. Find a different rationality, and integrate it.

No matter what Teal conveys, Green will psychoanalyze the         Teal thinker and explain how Teal's need for a map of reality exposes a childish need for         control and certainty, and putting people in Levels is just a way for social outcasts to feel superior to the         masses who somehow "fit in". What Green will never         do until it grows up a Level is attempt to comprehend Levels.

What is breathtaking about this model is the rainbow of Levels reflected across the four Quadrants, illustrating the emergence of similar structural themes in self, culture, local and systemic nature. This is because Altitudes are the same memetic (or noetic) structures, arising in four Quadrant perspectives. They intersect our brains, our lives, our interactions, and society itself. </p><h2 data-v-7d4afa00>Four Ways to Look At Everything</h2><p data-v-7d4afa00> Reality has an inside and outside, and it occurs at an individual and collective level. This description of Quadrants may seem exotic at first, but it&#39;s very matter of fact. You are in here, world is out there, you&#39;re one person in a social system. When we conjugate our language, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;We&quot;, &quot;It&quot;, and &quot;Its&quot;, we show that we know Quadrants intuitively, if not explicitly. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00>Each Quadrant correctly answers the question, <b data-v-7d4afa00>&quot;What is the nature of reality?&quot;</b> A superior answer would thus include all four. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00><b data-v-7d4afa00>Upper Left &quot;I&quot; interior individual:</b> My present consciousness, memories, stories, sensations, feelings, thoughts. <br data-v-7d4afa00><b data-v-7d4afa00>Reality: </b>I am this mind, aware of my thoughts and sensations, my story, and all the things I know of. This room, this world, and other people, all exist in my mind, as information that I am aware of. I am reality. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00><b data-v-7d4afa00>Lower Left &quot;We&quot; interior collective:</b> The collective consensus which we develop through interpersonal communication. <br data-v-7d4afa00><b data-v-7d4afa00>Reality: </b>Relationships define our nature by socializing us into notions of who we are and what we do. We think the beliefs from our literature in the language of our culture. I&#39;m a name and address and a citizen of political designations, a member of ideological movements, a reputation and social credit. I am my job, my family, my country, my khakis. Moral actions are actions that positively affect people. That&#39;s our reality. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00><b data-v-7d4afa00>Lower Right &quot;It&quot; exterior individual:</b> The apparent physical environment, my brain, body, and physical senses. <br data-v-7d4afa00><b data-v-7d4afa00>Reality: </b>This brain interprets sense information into concepts so it can comprehend circumstances well enough to advantageously transform social and environmental outcomes, with the byproduct that it imagines itself into a supposedly cohesive story of my experience as a social being. I am chemicals, brainwaves, and cognitive functions. Everything this brain can directly sense and be logically certain of, that must be reality. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00><b data-v-7d4afa00>Upper Right &quot;Its&quot; exterior collective:</b> The dynamics of collective and social systems. <br data-v-7d4afa00><b data-v-7d4afa00>Reality: </b>The Universe produces human civilization through a tendency towards greater novelty and complexity called evolution. Civilization continues to evolve memetically, and I will play the minute role of being carried along or participating in the unfolding of this process, which is the nature of reality. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>What Is The Nature of Reality?</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> The four common answers given above are incomplete, unconsciously partial and limiting views of reality, and a full answer would include all four perspectives. Integral is not inventing Quadrants and trying to convince you they exist, but rather revealing that we already use them, mostly to exclude perspectives, and suggesting they actually don&#39;t exist.\u{1F609} By attempting to view a given scenario from all four Quadrants, you can at least ensure you&#39;re covering <em data-v-7d4afa00>the fundamental</em> blind spots. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Quadrant Fundamentalism</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> As you examine philosophy and thought, take care to observe positions that are firmly rooted in some Quadrants and in denial of others. <em data-v-7d4afa00>Only consciousness and the mind exist. Only material reality exists. We are one people. We are the thoughts of God. It&#39;s every man for himself.</em> Recognize how these positions result from fierce denial of reality and attachment to a Quadrant. Though they may superficially sound like the dissolution of Quadrants of higher Levels and deeper States, <em data-v-7d4afa00>denial</em> of perspectives is the key discernment. Quadrant fundamentalism and denial are obvious indicators of mental illness. Not surprisingly, a moderate bias is typical of human personality. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Language Structures Thought</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00>The Quadrants are conjugated outright in most languages, suggesting that an important distinction is reflected in perspectives: First, Second, and Third person, Singular and Plural. Classical milestones in human development include the formation of concepts of self, others, objectivity, and abstraction. In other words, the First Tier of Levels solidify consciousness into familiarity with the Quadrants. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> These four conjugations of reality are not only interconnected, but indeed are four aspects of a singular reality. This recognition informs Second Tier Levels. However, as an experience of being, or State or even Level of consciousness, one will note that key terms like &quot;oneness&quot;, &quot;union&quot;, and &quot;nonduality&quot; are all described conceptually in terms of a suspension of Quadrants. Awakening from the Quadrants seems perhaps synonymous with spiritual enlightenment. </p><h4 data-v-7d4afa00>I, We, It, or Its? </h4><p data-v-7d4afa00> It&#39;s a subtle point, but my language forces me to assign everything into a Quadrant when I think, when I communicate, and to use this language interface with everyone else. Thus we might find it odd to suggest that these perspectives are imaginary mental constructs, when they are entirely basic to our comprehension. Language is literally a mental prison. Kind of the only one. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Using Quadrants</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00>The main practical benefit is to recognize which Quadrants are focused on in a situation, and to zoom out holistically and utilize all four. In a particular sense - a kosmic evolutionary sense, Quadrants are the metaphorical or functional &quot;dimensions&quot; of reality. </p><h2 data-v-7d4afa00>Second Tier Marketing: Who Is Integral For?</h2><p data-v-7d4afa00><b data-v-7d4afa00>Upper-Left &quot;I&quot;:</b> Integral is a map for self help and personal development. It explains how to improve one&#39;s moods, relationships, and lifestyle, how transcendental states of consciousness work, what they reveal, and massively helps in the development of personal insight, spirituality, and maturity. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00><b data-v-7d4afa00>Lower-Left &quot;We&quot;:</b> Integral is a community, a values paradigm, a worldview, aimed at reconcilliation and inclusion of those extant. According to its own narrative, Integral is a Level of social organization based around shared recognition of evolutionary Levels and heirarchies of growth and inclusion, and Integral is the next major wave, or developmental Level the world will experience. If all of this makes sense to you, you are Integral to precisely that extent. No Kool-Aid to drink. If a map of the way humankind understands reality is recognizable and desired, the Integral &quot;We&quot; includes you.</p><p data-v-7d4afa00><b data-v-7d4afa00>Upper-Right &quot;It&quot;:</b> Ken Wilber provides a relatively simple, comprehensive philosophical orientation tool or ideological swiss army knife, enabling ready solutions to eternal problems. All extant concepts fit together in a single continuity, which applies very directly and progressively to every topic and field, including Wilber&#39;s work in philosophy, psychology, religion, spirituality, economics, sociology, anthropology, politics, history, business, sexuality, entertainment, literature, art, criticism, health, and lifestyle. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00><b data-v-7d4afa00>Lower-Right &quot;Its&quot;:</b> Integral is like a Rosetta Stone for comprehending how fields and systems are inter-related in the grandest scope. Embracing all of reality, it is applicable to every endeavor, and is best used as a universal translater, a way of reconciling disparate perspectives and checking in with every aspect of the big picture. </p><h2 data-v-7d4afa00>Social Holon: A Four Quadrant Stack of Levels</h2><p data-v-7d4afa00><b data-v-7d4afa00>A holon is a whole composed of parts, and also is itself a part of a greater whole. </b>The Quadrants illustrate how a singular &quot;holonic&quot; source unfolds in and expresses all four dimensions simultaneously, rendering all four quadrants equally and entirely real. Everything certainly real exists in all four Quadrants and is a holon. Everything not real, by debatable standards, exists in some Quadrants, but not all, and thus is not a holon either. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Examples of Debatably Real Things</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00><b data-v-7d4afa00>\u{1F621} Buloney: </b>A lie is an exclusively LL reality that is unreal to the subjective teller of it, and is untrue in physical reality. This would result in a misunderstanding where if you believed the lie, it would then be true only in the UL, so ultimately false. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00><b data-v-7d4afa00>\u{1F52E} Divination: </b>Astrology exists in the interior Quadrants as a way of determining a person&#39;s overall character based on their date of birth. It exists in the Left Hand Quadrants because we know of it and some of us believe in it. Since there is no logical causative mechanism, astrological typing is a mythological system in the LR, and false in UR objective reality as scientific investigation has revealed no merit to astrological personality assessment. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00><b data-v-7d4afa00>\u{1F47B} Ghosties: </b>An imaginary friend or hallucinated entity has a false status in the interior Quadrants, existing as a projection of the personality of the subject, incorrectly appearing to exist in objective reality. This entity is not objectively or inter-subjectively real. Near Death Experiences are entirely subjective by nature, so the best we can say is not that they are &quot;real&quot; or true, but they seem to be somewhat universal in the human experience of death. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00><b data-v-7d4afa00>\u{1F332}\u{1F609} Unsolved: </b>A person dies with a secret they never told anyone. The secret is entirely true, but nobody will ever find out, and it will never have any effect on anyone. Thus, it makes no difference whether you consider it real or not. Trees fall in the forest all the time. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Quadrants within Quadrants</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00>Nearly all perspectives we encounter are compound views. For example, if I describe my car to you, I&#39;m describing an UR machine from my perspective, which is UL, but I&#39;m trying to convey things of interest to you, implying a shared LL between us, and we may talk vehicle makes and models and market prices, all LR. Anyways, the perspective that you yourself would end up with would be a LL view, shared between us, of the car existing in the UR. This issue becomes central in describing the Levels. Every Level can be described in each Quadrant, and each of these can be seen from each quadrant, for a total of 16 basic descriptive perspectives. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>More of Reality in Fewer Words</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> At a deeper level, Integral post-metaphysics reveals that probably the most accurate generalization that can be made about reality, nature, the self, or society, is that it&#39;s an evolutionary system unfolding holonic Levels across simultaneous interior, exterior, individual and collective perspectives. You can&#39;t just go around saying things like that without explaining yourself. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Everything Is Holons</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00>A word of caution. As we walk around looking at things in real life and trying to understand how they are holons, we may have to introduce some further terms in order to comprehensively include all of reality without confusion. This is entirely due to us referencing things with a non-holonic linguistic comprehension of nature. Many of our verbal concepts refer to <b data-v-7d4afa00>heaps</b> and <b data-v-7d4afa00>artifacts.</b></p><p data-v-7d4afa00> \u{1F5FB} A <b data-v-7d4afa00>heap</b> is a collective grouped by coincidental, arbitrary, or subjective distinction, such as a sand dune, the hundreds of words for &quot;snow&quot; arctic natives may use, or for example, &quot;the birds on the lawn.&quot; Those references are not proper collectives (holons/Quadrants), as their group cohesion is not structural, but linguistic and contextual. The birds in the yard may exhibit collective behaviors, like if a horn honks, they all scatter, and they have come here because of the types of trees you have, eg. But the birds are a heap, not a holon, because they are grouped by the unrelated properties of being a bird, and being in this yard. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> Your memory is somewhat of a &quot;heap&quot; of human experience, just a collection of human events happening mostly at random, by coincidence, and due to circumstances largely outside of individual awareness or control, which unconscious processes selected to either remember or forget. It becomes easy to see how most of the concepts we work with are deeply-layered abstractions that we assume to be just as &quot;real&quot; as the social holons which are reality. This sort of holonic confusion results from a human perspective comprehending reality based on mental, linguistic, and social constructs. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00>\u270F\uFE0F An <b data-v-7d4afa00>artifact</b> is a collective assembled by a higher Level social holon. A pencil, for example, has fallen very far from the tree that produced its wood. There is nothing in the nature of a tree or a forest that would suggest it would ever become a pencil, unless there were industrial peoples with sophisticated tools, rubber, graphite, and technological memes. Likewise, a beehive would never arise naturally from its component substances, but is rather constructed by the instincts of bee colonies. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> Again, reflecting the inevitable bias of the human condition, most of our vocabulary refers to deliberate practical assemblies of substances and technological memes: chair, car, meal, garden, house, downtown, schedule, outfit, internet, story, disposition. The fabric that yoga pants are made out of does not arise substantially in nature. It doesn&#39;t grow on trees. So, we, these apes of the Earth, might call synthetic fabrics &quot;unnatural&quot; (or GMOs, detergents, plastics, airplanes, nukes, etc.). Well, it&#39;s quite natural for conscious human civilizations to reorder molecules in this way to show off their butts, or mutually assure the destruction of civilization, whatever \u{1F937}\u{1F3FF}\u200D\u2642\uFE0F. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> Artifacts have a special status, in that they somewhat distort the integral perspective. Our mental world is a world of practical and social, as opposed to natural (holonic), concepts. This is a main reason that holonic or Integral Theory may seem abstract or cerebral to newcomers, precisely <em data-v-7d4afa00>because</em> it is the opposite! All of reality is holons, but our awareness and the language we use necessarily surrounds us with heaps and artifacts, and that&#39;s great for everyday functions, but psychologically, it obscures the profound clarity that this grand symphony could be as simple as Levels and Quadrants. </p>',43),$e=u("<h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Levels and Quadrants</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00>A most fascinating aspect of Altitudes that it is easy to miss, is that they emerge in all four Quadrants. These underlying memetic holons, the core patterns of humanity, the spectrum or visible light range of history, occur in myself, in my own thoughts and feelings. They dictate the way stories are told, and critiqued, whether they are permissable. They deliver our tech base. These thoughts and feelings I have are the foundation of civilization in certain eras of history. There is an enormous global community sharing overall conceptions of the nature of reality with me, all throughout history. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> \u{1F9EC} A baby born now begins fundamentally the same as early hominids of the upper paleolithic, and will proceed through each of the Levels that society itself developed through. All great art and literature are expressions of Levels, sometimes challenging contemporary Levels, and sometimes serving as foundation to emergent Levels at the time. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> In each Level we observe a re-ordering of Quadrant perspectives. For example, Red, Orange, Teal, Indigo, and Ultraviolet stress forms of objectivity and individualism or agency, while Magenta, Amber, Green, Green, Turquoise, Violet, and Clearlight stress subjectivity and collectivism or communion. This classically male/female dualism is not some magic spell built into the fabric of evolution, it is rather just the effect of a season-style pattern. In development, we cycle between extremes of thought, feeling, and action in an effort to synthesize or inhabit both sides of a duality. The developmental path for the individual is a process of integrating cognitive dissonance. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Lines and Quadrants</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00>In nearly every case, a particular Line will only study or observe a single Quadrant. Thus, advances in medicine, psychology, social sciences, and economics appear to exist each in their own domain while of course they are all naturally implicated in one another. Integral Thought portrays the overlap in these four perspectives, and in the individual developmental Lines or multiple intelligences, as Altitudes Levels. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Types and Quadrants</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00>It would not be novel at all to say that many, perhaps the majority, of personality typologies, are based on medieval classical elements (earth, air, water, and fire) which correspond to the four secular seasons and formerly dominated type theory in systems East and West, as well as medicine in the theory of sanguine, phlegmatic, melancholic, and choleric temperaments and many aspects of esoteric philosophy and alchemy. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00>These notions are not obscure antiquities, but foreshadow our current understanding. These medieval mythological concepts helped Carl Jung to develop his own typology, which entirely informed the development of the Myers-Briggs system. Thus, small world, there really aren&#39;t a lot of typologies in common usage, other than colloquial observational truisms of the nature, &quot;You know Julie, there&#39;s two types of people in this world, XXXXXers, and XXXXers.&quot; </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> Observe particularly in the writings of Jung that this elemental typology, or the four cognitive functions, is equivalent to one&#39;s relationship with Quadrants. Meanwhile, we see exactly the same thing expressed in the East as Taoism. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>\u262F\uFE0F</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> The duality, or Tao, which exists on every Level of nature is expressed on Earth as seasons, in life as birth and death, in animals as sex and in culture as gender. In personality, the duality is expressed as extroversion or objectivity attitude towards the left and right Quadrants, as well as affinity with individuality or collectivism. These four functional types (Quadrants) were called by Jung intuition, sensing, thinking, and feeling. Here is a table expressing the relationships between these. </p><table data-v-7d4afa00><tr data-v-7d4afa00><th data-v-7d4afa00>UL: Intuition</th><th data-v-7d4afa00>UR: Sensing</th></tr><tr data-v-7d4afa00><th data-v-7d4afa00>LL: Feeling</th><th data-v-7d4afa00>LR: Thinking</th></tr></table><p data-v-7d4afa00>As we observe repeatedly, each Quadrant can be viewed through a Quadrant, which results in the compounded multiplicity of perspectives we encounter in Jungian types as well as Quadrant reality itself. Thus, the extraversion attitude and superiority parameter of a cognitive function give us Quadrants to view these Quadrants through. This is to say that many, or most, Typologies, or the Types module itself, can largely be seen as another way of expressing Quadrants, this case in human personality. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> The Big Five traits (Types) correlate with Quadrant types, except for neuroticism. Many systems such as the enneagram use divisions of three to express fundamentally similar personality factors, most typically accomplished by squishing the right quadrants together, or by defining the intersection of Quadrants as points of reference. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>States and Quadrants</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> Most descriptions of transcendental or spiritualized states of consciousness seem to relate a sort of dissolution of Quadrants. The enlightened being has gone beyond self, become one with all of existence, experiences deep interpenetrating communion with all sentient beings, dissolves into the unbounded infinite void of the kosmos, understands itself to be nothing but the eternal conscious awareness of material reality, feels the world and people around itself as its own skin, expresses radical loving compassion that sees deeper into you than you do, is radiantly annointed with the light of creation. <b data-v-7d4afa00>Sounds familiar?</b></p><p data-v-7d4afa00> Nearly all descriptions of spirituality across time and tradition involve transcending the mentally constructed boundaries of Quadrants. In other words, nondual enlightenment can be expressed as the experience of being entirely I, We, It, and Its, at once. You are just as much the story of your life as you are the Big Bang, just as much the developmental efforts of sentient beings throughout history as you are the systems and infrastructure which organize it. Truly, you are a stack of Levels in Quadrants. </p>",18),Re=u('<h1 id="left-right" data-v-7d4afa00>Internal and External</h1><p data-v-7d4afa00>The <b data-v-7d4afa00>Internal</b> of reality is everything mental or subjective in nature, while the <b data-v-7d4afa00>External</b> refers to the objective and material. As we hope to demonstrate, it is easy to define this duality at the extremes, but the boundary is more elusive. And this is because there is no boundary. Even though we conceptualize in Quadrants before we learn the Quadrants, they are actually unreal. Internal and External, subject and object, are two ways of looking at the same thing. Ways of looking, in this sense, could mean interface, lens, or paradigm. However, the subject/object split is among perhaps the most basic universal concepts of the human mind, among the most foundational to human thinking, and so not surprising that we assume it to be an aspect of consciousness or reality, as opposed to a mental construct. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>We Live In A Dream</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> It should be noted that the apparent environment surrounding you is not the actual physical environment surrounding you. It is a mental construction based off of sense information, memory, and assumption, catering to what you focus on and are aware of. We as minds never experience anything but mind. Our stories are the only sense that is made of reality, our understanding is the only knowledge in existence. The material world is a sort of mental abstraction that we deduce from experience, organized entirely by the history and priorities of the development of human thought through Levels (Altitudes). </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>We Live in a Simulation</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> I can make the opposite point. As a matter of fact, your apparent subjective consciousness is not the mind of any person at all. You don&#39;t exist. This environment produced people, your family produced your body and named you this name and raised the person to believe they exist and are real, this room has your brain in it and your brain is detecting sensory information and supplying you with memories and assumptions, all in service of generating this illusion that you exist and are experiencing this body and this environment and this story of your life. It&#39;s just electrical activity in a homo sapiens brain, yo. That&#39;s what you are. The electrical activity tells itself a story about a person over the course of the body&#39;s run. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>We Live in Reality?</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00>I have made two classical, dualistic, seemingly contradictory yet both compelling arguments for the nature of reality. You could call them Interior and Exterior fundamentalism. Our mental conditioning as people causes the apparent paradox that the only thing we know is an illusion generating itself for no reason. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> Integration of these opposing perspectives seems to result in the reality that we experience. Because I want to be here, my brain generates thoughts and feelings in response to signals I recognize as patterns, and I choose between patterns to generate motivated thought, and this provokes the physical body of a person in an environment to do actions that will impact the interior thoughts and feelings of others. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> Lots of insides, lots of outsides, no actual boundaries, but that is the reality that we experience. It is nondual, but as we imagine it now, it is dualistic, with simultaneous Quadrants experienced as &quot;in here&quot; and &quot;out there&quot;. This is an interface, or framework, which structures our experience. Prior to introducing such an interface, reality is experienced as a fusion of self and environment, and the baby is useless. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> Mastering the interface, Quadrants, tends to mark milestones of maturity in Levels. In the Third Tier Levels or spiritual States, nondual, union, or oneness, a deeper, higher, more supreme or true or absolute reality is discovered which is either described in terms of some poem about an owl covered in snow, or in a way that can be paraphrased as transcending the Quadrants. I and the father are one, etc. </p><h3 style="font-size:xxx-large;" data-v-7d4afa00>\u262F\uFE0F</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> Mirroring the Tao symbol with an &quot;eye&quot; of each side of duality existing within the other, objective reality is in fact imagined by a mind and not directly experienced. Subjectivity or consciousness is itself merely the virtualized experience of an entirely physical, material brain system. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> This is no paradox or riddle, just Quadrants. Free will and determinism are both perfectly true. They are internal and external perspectives on the unfolding of events. Every internal choice that you make was calculated by causative external events. It was the only choice you could end up making. Though you could have made the other choice, you didn&#39;t. When you make a choice, it doesn&#39;t create parallel universes in which you made other choices. If it did, we wouldn&#39;t know. What it does do, plainly, is demonstrate that you consciously participate in objective reality. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Conscious Participation Is a Force of Nature</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> Your choices are just as real and causative as any natural force. It isn&#39;t the case that your choices don&#39;t &quot;matter&quot; because your destiny is calculated by physics. That&#39;s like saying love is boring because it&#39;s calculated by reproduction. Category error. That your choices matter is an aspect of nature, a part of the entire physics of the kosmos, if you care, and if you say so. You&#39;re the sole being that certainly makes choices, you&#39;re the closest thing to certainty there could be. From this perspective, and objectively, human choice is the most powerful force in the known universe in terms of its capabilities. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>What is Power?</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> A quasar is a truly incomprehensible matter-consuming entity that is unfathomably large, but has no desire to do anything and must fall and dissipate forever. An ant can lift fifty times its own weight, but it can&#39;t stop a human toddler from mangling it. I can smush the ant, but I can also not smush it. That&#39;s power. I can say mean things to you and hurt your feelings, but anything I could think to do with a quasar, if it were even possible, would annihilate myself as well. If anything were capable of getting a quasar to harm you without harming me, I have to imagine human choice would be involved. Only human choice has the physical ability to accomplish purposeful things. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Quantumization of Philosophy</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00>As a culture, we seem to fall deeper and deeper into denial of the only thing that surely exists, consciousness. The only answers we trust come from the material sciences, dealing with a world we do not know, at a scale we do not experience. We wonder if science can discover the nature of mind in the mathematical abstractions suggested by the behavior of things so tiny that the notion of observation becomes nonsensical. Scientists can study the brain, and the microcosmic, but there&#39;s no profit in the nature of mind. That&#39;s not science&#39;s role. It&#39;s ours. Scientists don&#39;t waste their time on dimebag crap like this. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>The Universe is the Nature of Mind</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> Literally, the Universe is this big factory that transforms matter into mind, according to me, itself. I wouldn&#39;t be here if it didn&#39;t do that. Why does it do that? Does it like doing that? Ask me. I&#39;m some Universe. I&#39;m glad to be alive, so yeah, the Universe likes generating consciousness according to itself. There really is no problem here, philosophically. We have no choice but to voluntarily, gladly participate in the Universe&#39;s evolution from matter to life to mind and onward. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Consciousness Today</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00>The average educated person has a limited understanding of consciousness - which is strange, as it is what we are. We lend credence to scientific approaches, and the methodologies of science have told us many things about how brains work, but they leave the nature of consciousnessness to philosophy, the psyche to psychology, and the mind to literature. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Science and Consciousness</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> Science concerns itself with nature and the causative forces of reality. The mind is real, and supremely causative. If you consider it carefully, a mental science is literally just abstract analytical logic applied introspectively, as in Integral Theory, or it would otherwise more practically be a system for developing insight, also Integral Theory. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Am I Brainwaves or Experience?</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00>Yes. The Quadrants mean you&#39;re both. Consciousness and brainwaves are not coincidental. They are one and the same, viewed from inside and outside. Neither could exist without the other. Two perspectives on a single phenomenon. Without your brain, you wouldn&#39;t be here. If you weren&#39;t here, your brain can&#39;t be doing what it&#39;s doing right now. As you see directly right now, reality is a relationship between an objective, external world out there, and beings of that world experiencing it internally, in here. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>The Fundamental Split</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00>One of the first cognitive stages of an infant can be described as going from an animal-like state of fusion consciousness to differentiating self from environment. Very pivotal and useful, but it must truly be comprehended that this is only an interface. It&#39;s so entrenched that you probably think I&#39;m crazy, but truly, our sensory experience does not naturally differentiate self from environment. We sort that out mentally, and we do it so fast and so habitually and perhaps even instinctually, that we are unaware of it. And in this moment, this sense of you subjectively being in here, facing an objective world out there, forms the vertical axis of the Quadrants. Your experience is the Upper Left, &quot;I&quot; Quadrant. Your environment, which you only experience in an abstract sense, through processing sensory information and recognizing patterns in it, is the Right or external Quadrants, or objective reality. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>The Conscious Kosmos</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> Expand your notion of the universe to include this notion of consciousness, of holon interiority, and you start to see the Integral kosmos. Just simply, you&#39;re the kosmos, all of it. Do you think it&#39;s a coincidence that you&#39;re you, on this planet, in this time, interacting with me right now? Do you think it&#39;s some sort of absurd, ridiculous comedy of errors that produced intelligent life on Earth? Don&#39;t most of us actually think that? Well, of course, the reason most of us think that is that we used to say this really, really big dude controls everything that happens, and we killed everyone that didn&#39;t believe that. So now it all happens just because. Net improvement. If we can salvage one thing, though, maybe to remind ourselves that I&#39;m the animate, moral kosmos. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>A New Genesis Hypothesis</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> In general, a theory that is absurdly improbable and lacking coherence in terms of the causal connection between its component parts should be rejected. Instead, you might take the given nature of reality which presents itself as the nature of reality. We&#39;re left to gather that what&#39;s happening here, where I&#39;m explaining what&#39;s happening here, is as usual, utterly typical. This is exactly what I would do, as a normal person, if given the opportunity, as biological planets tend to become self aware, and they act as us people to spread awareness via communication. The universe is a creator, that&#39;s its actual character, and thus our character. It creates mental beings out of nothing, as we observe. Watch what it does next. I&#39;m watching. Go. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Evolutionary Impulse</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00>The universe tends, or leans, towards higher Levels. As seen here. Just due to the nature of reality, a planet like Earth would fall into having life, and eventually life would very likely fall into sentience and civilization. Why would a universe or planet act this way? </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> The prevailing scientific perspective that the origin of life on Earth, the evolution of life towards more progressive forms, life becoming self aware, self awareness forming civilization - all happen on accident for no reason just because. This all occurs in a cold, dead, empty, remote, lifeless, unconscious, probabilistic universe - it&#39;s a miracle! A total accident, huge fluke. A coincidence which comes but once in billions of years of billions of galaxies. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> What a disappointment it would be to learn that there is no miracle, that everything happening is precisely what a functional universe does mechanically, that the kosmic absolute, the central organizing law, is unfolding Levels of social holons whose only commonality is an innate tendency to evolve. In other words, it&#39;s all about love. There&#39;s no scientific reason to believe that whatsoever other than everything in existence. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00>And you may feel frustrated or confused. You may ask why, why does the kosmos always do this? Where are the tiny, oh so tiny building blocks and imaginary waves that prove this true or false? I&#39;m some idiot, I don&#39;t know. But let&#39;s have a look. You have all the Levels. Atoms. Molecules. Cells. Mind. So you tell us. Why are you doing this? </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Developmental Reality</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00>Let&#39;s take every great eternal unsolved mystery: Why did the Big Bang happen? Why did Earth chemicals come to life? Why did life become self conscious? Why did Jennifer dump me? What is the point of what is happening? Why am I experiencing this person that I apparently am? </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> Let&#39;s answer all of them. The structural nature of reality is that holons organize into higher Level holons. A higher Level holon means it is constructed of lower holons. As these holons organize or evolve over the history of the universe into conscious organisms, those creatures internally organize into sentient mental beings, experiencing individuality within a collective from internal and external perspectives. If those individuals aren&#39;t treating one another right, maybe they ought to aim higher. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Consciousness of Atoms</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> To illustrate the evolutionary nature of the Quadrants, it is essential that we understand that the interiority of Quadrants goes <em data-v-7d4afa00>all the way down.</em> This is not to suggest that atoms are conscious like we are. The nature of what should be considered &quot;consciousness&quot; is a matter of Levels. As complex mental beings, our interiority is readily self-apparent. I think therefore I am. What about a cat? A cat doesn&#39;t think, but it lives, and it has a personality of sorts. Does the cat have no soul? Is it just anthropomorphic fallacy to think that a cat has interiority? Of course not. We know that we share the brain functions of emotions and instinctual response with animals, so as we climb down the kosmic evolutionary ladder, we find that cats are conscious, but in a categorically different way than humans are. What about plants? Do plants experience in some way? Well, they respond to stimuli. They respirate. Is there a sort of soul in all of life? Well, we can say that there must be more &quot;soul&quot; or consciousness, within the experience of being a plant, than there is in the experience of being a rock or a molecule. And finally, I must insist that while a rock, or a molecule, shows nothing resembling what we would consider consciousness, would you not accept that the material existence of a thing lends it more of a sense of informational existence than nothing at all? And so, the truly holistic, Turquoise, or ultimately Integral view of reality is illustrated below.

data-v-7d4afa00>Developer Kosmos</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00>Carrying this narrative forward, we&#39;re assuming that what is happening here is in every respect just naturally how the kosmos works. We don&#39;t live in a kosmos that works some other way where this defies reason. The Big Bang was a process that differentiated some sort of primordial singularity into molecules that would ultimately form galaxies with stellar and planetary systems. We can assume this is normal. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00>Any planet would produce life. Molecules will tend to become organic molecules if given the opportunity. It is not that Earth is particularly special, it is that molecules are special, that the universe is special, that it falls towards consciousness over time. This is just another fundamental dynamic of how it works, just like how all matter attracts all other matter and how going fast makes time slow down, how matter seems to be vibrations of hyper-dimensional nano-strings from a mathematical perspective. People find that easy to accept. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> These fundamental mysteries are actually the basis upon which to hypothesize that the kosmos has a sort of meta-magnetic nature, or morphogenetic field. It tends up Levels. It gets off on it or something. You are not some weird crazy mutant. You are the mental being that kosmic code generates from nothing. You are the world&#39;s molecules that wake up and come to life, because that is what planets do, because you want to. Creation myths and Big Bang science are all true enough. We are created in the image of a creator. The Big Bang and ourselves have everything in common. It&#39;s not coincidence, it&#39;s mutual expression. As kosmos representatives, we&#39;re here learning about reality, because that&#39;s what matter would do if it were smart, which it will be eventually. Like clockwork. \u{1F636}\u200D\u{1F32B}\uFE0F </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Really Literally</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> You&#39;re a stack of Levels in four Quadrants. Reality and the kosmos are Levels in Quadrants. Quarks seem to be some kind of informational vectors which assemble into the general vibe of a subatomic particle, whose interactions are atoms, which interact to form molecules. We have already traversed an incomprehensible scale, but molecules can be assembled into organic forms, which can be cells, such as the cells of your body, your brain cells, even. Each Level includes the previous Level into a greater system of order. Instinct Leveled towards more complex, self-aware organisms. Awareness Leveled towards communication. Communication Leveled towards social organization. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> If you move your hand, you move the atoms of your hand, you make it the case that Earth produces people who move their hand, and you change the entire universe into one in which a person moved their hand there. All at once. No trick. We&#39;re a stack of Levels in four Quadrants. </p>',55),je=u('<h1 id="up-down" data-v-7d4afa00>Individual and Collective</h1><p data-v-7d4afa00> It&#39;s easy to overlook the fundamental tendency of reality to express pattern repetition. There are countless molecules, countless stars, countless people, countless perspectives, countless brain states. Each has statistical differences, but each conforms to the general rules that define it: every star is different, but every star is similar enough to be called a star. This is the <b data-v-7d4afa00>Individual</b> and <b data-v-7d4afa00>Collective</b> of nature, found in every instance of reality, on every occasion. Every horse is unique, but is also just a horse. Every feeling is unique, but can be named. It&#39;s not that everything belongs to categories, but that category patterns (memes/archetypes/ideals) generate the instances which are apparent. There is nothing in reality that doesn&#39;t have a collective and individual aspect. There is no plant without a species, no person that isn&#39;t a primate, no house that&#39;s safe from planetary annihilation. Everything in reality is self-evidently unique, and uniqueness of course can&#39;t exist within the generative constraints. Quadrants create these apparent &quot;paradoxes.&quot; There is no spoon. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>External Collectives: Lower Right</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> The Earth atom assembly flows in a solar system which flows in a galaxy. Molecules can form mountains, flow as rivers, move as winds. A tree participates in a forest. A flock of birds illustrates collective movement as they each adapt to one another&#39;s motions. A species can thrive or become extinct. An angry mob rushes to Frankenstein&#39;s castle as the majority of individuals move in that direction. I owe work and taxes because I was born. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Internal Collectives: Lower Left</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> I participate in Integral Theory, as does your opinion. We are presently participating in one another&#39;s lives. As we experience events together, we each have separate mental experiences, and the collective total of our experience, through communication, reveals <em data-v-7d4afa00>more</em> reality, potentially, than each individual&#39;s experience. The sum total of human knowledge and perspective is infinitely superior to that of the individual, but unfortunately, communication greatly limits our ability to share, and to receive. We each walk around with a tiny, hazy pinhole sliver of the collective comprehension. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> Extraversion and introversion outcomes demonstrate that the communicated views of an incidental collective are neither clearly superior nor inferior to that individual&#39;s own native capacities. The integrated mind is ambidextrous; the individual and collective supplement one another. To be smarter, be easier. To be easier, be smarter. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>I Am The Collective</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> I learn by reading books and being educated through relationships, and commercial and public interests, in their language, with their politics, technology, and style. Only then can I apply that abstract understanding to my own personal use cases and develop my own divergent aesthetic, and that is only received well if my divergence reflects a collective trend. About half of reality is governed by the collective. Language, for example. Nobody came up with it, everybody learned it. Our collective consciousness, though it is abstract conceptually, is actually the only route to high-Level knowledge and awareness, such as we all have. In order for us to think with linguistic concepts, we must exist in a universe and world that produces advanced brain functions, and then socially teaches those brains how to reflect upon nature mentally. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00>Knowing this, it makes you wonder what you might be missing out on.</p><p data-v-7d4afa00> Everything that a mental being can think, feel, or do is an expression of one or many synthesized patterns, memes, ideals, or archetypes. This is simply because a mental being is limited to executing only those functions that exist in its mental reality. It should be remarked that both nature, and the mind, are astoundingly, incredibly, utterly incapable of creativity in a genuine sense, and said creativity appears to be expressed over time entirely in the form of the evolutionary, holonic development or unfolding of Levels towards greater emergent novelty, complexity, awareness, intelligence, sensitivity, and inclusion. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Consider a Molecule</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> A molecule can be seen in terms of its individual structure, or in terms of its relationship with other molecules. Here, we can point out a subtle misunderstanding which is common. The molecule, like everything, has a holonic nature. There is a special sort of &quot;collective&quot; (social holon) formed by atoms grouping together into molecules, and these molecules form a sort of collective to make substances. In the Integral view, these are Levels, <em data-v-7d4afa00>not</em> Quadrants. The Lower Right quadrant of an Upper Right atom is not a molecule or a chair or everything inside the planet&#39;s atmosphere, but the universe itself, or whatever you consider the entire collective of atoms. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Social Holons at Every Level</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> Atoms, molecules, substances, cells, thought patterns, are Levels of material reality that compose themselves holonically - by including individual wholes as parts into individual wholes which each themselves have collective social dynamics at each Level. At the Level of molecules, we can see that molecules exert forces and have interactions with one another, they can align into magnetic or chrystalline configurations, they may collectively have a net charge, mass, alkalinity, they exhibit material states and flow dynamics. At the Life Levels, we may observe that matter has evolved this special band of Levels that behave utterly different from how other substances behave - <em data-v-7d4afa00>it&#39;s alive!</em> Every creature has organic structures, and indeed, consciousness, catering to its role in a web of life or food chain. Creatures behave according to instincts, which are granted by genes, which result from web of life and food chain dynamics. At the Mind Levels, we see how genetic instinct delivered the material molecules of Earth through Life Levels, up to this point where we talk and scheme. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>What is a Man?</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> A similar temptation is to identify the collective of an individual as the Earth, or the Universe, because it&#39;s bigger and it contains me, or to identify the biosphere as the collective of civilization. Silly notions like that. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Let&#39;s Break This Down</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> The Earth and myself have Levels. I&#39;m a social holon, Earth is a heap (the molecules which fell into this orbital band of the sun after much smashing around.) Earth is a rare planet, extremely rare, possibly unique at this moment, in that it has Life and Mind Levels right now. We know of countless other planets, but none which think, feel, or commit conscious actions through people and creatures. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> Other than that, utterly typical planet on an unremarkable star in a random galaxy, far as we know. When molecules fall into planets, they don&#39;t typically have Life and Mind Levels. Thinking of what&#39;s happening here (Mind and Life) as geological or astronomical is somewhat category error, as we know ourselves to be an extreme outlier as a planet, and as molecules. This is how higher Levels look from lower Levels. They are rare and strange, alien pioneers in a savage frontier. Yang penetrating the sacred heart of yin. Hero in the labyrinth where the snake encircles the treasure. Social holons. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Fleeting Glimpse</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> The higher the Level, the more logarithmically rare and brief. Earth is ordinary, but planetary Life is highly uncommon. In the context of Earth, Life is commonplace, and Mind is exceedingly brief and rare and small in comparison. It should be noted that nondual enlightenment is about as frequent among people today as this trend suggests, being the highest Level. Since higher Levels are literally composed of special configurations (social holons) of lower Levels, there will always be infinitely more low-Level holons than high, at scales of extraordinary magnitude. It&#39;s a pyramid scheme. \u{1F441}\uFE0F </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>\u{1F30D} You&#39;re not my collective. \u{1F63F}</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> While it is intuitive to think of Earth as our collective, in fact, it is an utter, total coincidence to everyone but the molecule pioneer forefathers who long ago somehow became proteins, and those proteins which learned to use fire to cook food, that I and my collective are on the surface of this planet heap. Likewise, it seems to me from my perspective utter coincidence who I am and when and where I&#39;m living. It has nothing to do with anything which one I am. Oh, sure it does. As molecules, I&#39;m one with everything. The Mind is the one I refer to. It has learned Quadrants from social communication, and now it wonders why it is this one. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Because This One Is Perfect \u{1FAF6}\u{1F3FF}</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> You&#39;re the product of deliberate intentions of your cultural and social system. The way you see the world is what systems taught you, what&#39;s been curated, because anyone cared enough to do that for us. Your entire knowledge is only what <em data-v-7d4afa00>this</em> person has been exposed to since infancy. These stories of your life are the love you can feel, and you can feel it because it was modeled for you. What you know creates you. It isn&#39;t a coincidence to you that you&#39;re this one. It&#39;s very special and important to be the one you are, unless you think it isn&#39;t. You&#39;re The One who acts out your perspective and values in real life. You&#39;re the response to the injustice you see. You&#39;re the only possible solution. You&#39;re our only hope. That&#39;s the most important and meaningful thing in existence, so far. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Ad Nauseum: thank me later</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> Collective atoms are the universe. Earth is a coincidental molecular heap in the solar system, coincidentally heaped into the Milky Way \u{1F36B}. That&#39;s just apparently what molecules do. I&#39;m not part of Earth, my molecules are part of Earth. I&#39;m an ego person, whose collective is society and culture. I&#39;m not a Collective of my cells (the cell collective is the biosphere), I&#39;m a Level of my cells. Atoms, molecules, and cells are Levels of people, and likewise people are extremely rare potential Levels for atoms, molecules, and cells. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> The atoms of my body are Individual pieces of universe, and are also a holonic Level of myself. My molecules are Individual bits of the planet Earth, or a chemical configuration, and also a holonic Level of myself. My cells are Individuals within the biosphere of life on Earth, also a holonic Level of my tissues and organs and brain and me. My body is part of the animal kingdom, which is a Level of evolution in my genes. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> My self-aware human brain puts me at an extremely rare, advanced Level that is not found elsewhere in the Universe, in chemistry, or in animals. The holonic Levels of Mind, or Altitudes, only occur in human people as far as we know. The collective of me is us, not Earth, not the universe. The collective of us, humanity, is not Earth or the Universe, but rather, that <em data-v-7d4afa00>is</em> the people collective, or collective consciousness. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>The Chicken and the Egg</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00>A question that insists on the discernment of Upper and Lower: they came together. It started laying and in that moment became &quot;chicken&quot;. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> You may think of yourself as an individual, isolated self. This way of self-conceptualizing was taught to you by others. You learned by imitation. Your concepts come from literature and media, from family and peers, from traditions and education systems, from brain chemistry, resulting in personality. The language you think and communicate in was taught to you. You continue the story of your family, your country, the people of the world, you represent the nature of consciousness itself. From the perspective of everyone else in the world, your interior is nothing more than an abstract assumption. Something which is real to you and nobody else would seem to be the least real thing there could be, and so the internal experience we call &quot;my reality&quot; is in fact the only thing that could possibly <em data-v-7d4afa00>not</em> be real. But of course, here you are, and it has four Quadrants. </p>',33),Pe=u('<h1 id="upper-left" data-v-7d4afa00>Upper Left: Interior Individual</h1><p data-v-7d4afa00>Your thoughts, feelings, physical sensations, the experience of being an individual person. The Upper Left can only be known by the individual, and is composed of things that are directly experiential in nature, so cannot be communicated or conveyed in an absolute sense. Upper Left has no physical existence, as identity, concepts, values, dreams, aesthetics, and guesses, for example, are mental, cerebral, abstract, or experiential in nature. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>UL Applications</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> The Upper Left can be developed through meditation, contemplation, introspection, and self-reflection. Psychology offers us pathways to insight, as spiritual disciplines reveal astounding domains of the unconscious. Our general personal style, tone, temperament, type, mood, or feel are all aspects of our Upper Left that spill across into the Lower Left cultural domain and become descriptive of our individual character. Experience is the Upper Left of our Upper Right brain functions. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>UL Health</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00>A person&#39;s capacity for self-honesty forms the basis of their self worth and personal integrity. We must always be attentive to our needs and desires and self-opinion, and exploring subconscious depths of our personal nature. The intuitive function of the mind is simply to experience mental content without a goal in mind, and thus we gain familiarity, coordination, and depth in the intellectual realm. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>UL Pathology</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> An overly strong preference for the Upper Left may result in narcissism, isolation, being socially perceived as strange, overly cerebral, or unmannered. Reflection and introspection can result in depression, worsened by having a strong sense of personal morality that is misunderstood as suspicious because it is well constructed and considered and thought out. A lack of focus on external and collective Quadrants can result in a lack of personal success and interpersonal connection. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Stages in the UL</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> Interior individual consciousness develops through a holonic progression of stages of self conceptualization. Each stage builds upon the previous self concept via integration of prior assumptions into a new pattern. We can visualize it like zooming out a perspective. Our subjective perspective transforms by zooming out to see competing perspectives, forming a new perspective which now sees the previous perspectives as existing among many. We can then integrate those perspectives into a meta-perspective which transcends, but includes, the previous perspective. Each Level creates a new subjective reality by including the previous subjective realities as objects of awareness. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>Evolving Four Selves</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> All Altitudes unfold according to this holonic, or dialectic, pattern, but as you can see, this is complicated, so in our simplified mini-model, we can say that lower Levels experience Upper Left as a Personality in response, or reaction, to reality in the present. Through experience, the Personality develops a cohesion of its range of moods and tones, some awareness of the mechanisms of the objective world, and begins to see themselves as an Ego: a rational agent telling a personal story over the course of a lifetime in relationship with others and with history. This Ego begins to gain awareness of fundamental uniting truths, and the invisible forces underlying the mental activities, and so starts the course of developing towards a total Psyche, or psychic being. This can then proceed through transcendental state practice into an affinity with the entire kosmic interior itself, or pure Consciousness without subject or object. In each case, it is a matter of healing the cognitive dissonance of a fundamental split in reality, or duality of the mind, by embracing and integrating the supposed opposing side. The Tao is just all four at once. </p>',12),Be=d(()=>e("h1",{id:"lower-left"},"Lower Left: Interior Collective",-1)),Ue=d(()=>e("p",null,' This is the domain of culture and interpersonal relationships. Every person is taught to be a person by their parents, their peers, their educators and guardians. A large part of the personality and self concept is not a unique creation, but a system of mimmicked habits, or memes, consciously and unconsciously taught to us by culture. The heros and villains, celebrities, and important individuals in our lives become a sort of collective story, an overall narrative involving a team of relevant characters, the "We". The We ultimately "writes the history books", or decides what is important, what is moral, what is a true accomplishment, and what is worthy of looking at.

While the introvert experiences the UL as freedom and LL as constraint, the extravert experiences the LL as fullness and UL as loneliness. The extravert feels more whole or real in a group because their mental self is collective.

",-1)),Je=u('<h1 id="upper-right" data-v-7d4afa00>Upper Right: Exterior Individual</h1><p data-v-7d4afa00>Regardless of what you believe is happening, we can all agree objectively that experience occurs when a physically material human body with an advanced primate brain generates a characteristic waking brainwave pattern. Whatever happens to that brain directly produces the experience that you experience. In common speech, we use the word &quot;I&quot; to refer to both our mind, and our body. We don&#39;t call the body &quot;It&quot; because we understand ourself to be that body, as well as also being the mind. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> However, the brain really isn&#39;t the &quot;I&quot;, from the experience of the UL mind. This is to say, we did not even realize that awareness was generated by the brain until relatively recent. At present, even the best expert in the world would have a tough time making any sense out of the relationship between the physics and chemistry of the brain and the subtle operations of the psyche. Nobody looks at your physical brain to understand what you are thinking. The UR perspective prioritizes the sensing cognitive function, or directly experiencing physical reality through the senses. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> For the sake of simplicity, I refer to the UR brain functioning structures by vocabulary that comes more from UL self concepts like Personality, Ego, Psyche, and Consciousness. In this sense, I mean these structures as the brainwave patterns that generate these internal structures, and since we have no vocabulary for generalizing brainwave states into apparent structural social entities, I find that these terms suffice to account for the material, physical, structural reality of neuro-cognitive functions. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> A person who prefers the UR will be practical, logical, handy, reasonable, detailed, simple, and objective. They might be socially aloof, lacking personal insight or depth, and not very intellectual or abstract, but their rooting and groundedness in the Earthly realm of the material makes them sturdy, technical, and dependable. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>UR Applications</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00>Grounded in the UR, a person will prefer clear objective facts and tasks that allow them to physically manipulate reality. They may express that they don&#39;t feel like they are accomplishing anything by talking or moving data points, but they see results when the rubber hits the road. The upper right is the domain of skilled trades, mathematics and physical sciences, construction, engineering, architecture, deductive logic and procedural reasoning. The UR is often procedural, more comfortable working within standard logical roles, rules, and methods. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>UR Health</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00>While much of the information that reaches our consciousness may be ethereal abstractions, colored perceptions, deliberate misrepresentations, misunderstandings, or falsehoods, there is an absolute certainty in the solidity of the desk in front of me. The UR is both concrete and certain, so for the more extraverted and cerebral, it may be beneficial to take a moment and simply sense the reality occuring in this present environment and body, and to celebrate the power we have as physical entities to build, design, destroy, and optimize the objects surrounding us. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>UR Pathology</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00>The key pathology is alienation. Both individualistic and materialistic, the UR perspective can result in exclusive interest in apparent material reality, as other perspectives may seem overly abstract or vain. The isolation of lacking interpersonal connection and intimacy may lead to addictive and compulsive patterns unconsciously attempting to hack the physical chemistry of the body, and the disinterest in larger and grander narratives may result in superficial or transactional role relationships lacking in intimacy. </p>',11),Ve=u('<h1 id="lower-right" data-v-7d4afa00>Lower Right: Exterior Collective</h1><p data-v-7d4afa00>The exterior collective perspective views reality in terms of abstract but physically real systems. The lower right cognitive function is thinking, or using inductive reasoning to conceptualize organizational patterns in phenomena. This is typically the most difficult Quadrant to grasp, but a primary point of interest for Second Tier. When reality is conceptualized as holonic, the LR reveals nothing less than the functional meaning and purpose of the universe, and these dynamics, at least according to some idiot named Einstein, can be understood to reveal &quot;the thoughts of God.&quot; </p><p data-v-7d4afa00>From the LR perspective, I am most appropriately an instance of my highest self-recognized Level of consciousness. I continue to exist at all other LR Levels, of course, thus the atoms of me are part of the universe&#39;s physical system. The molecules of my body are part of the substance of Earth. As an animal, my body is part of the web of life. As a primate, my collective is the human species. As Magenta, my linguistic archetypes derive from the ancient lore of oral tradition. As Red, my concept of personal pride and glory come from legends of outstanding hero figures. As Amber, I was indoctrinated with part of the Western Judeo-Christian tradition and European colonialism against my will. As Orange, I have a liberal education and am part of the continuing American democratic revolution, participating in reasonable, procedural transactions between other free citizens. As Green, I participate in the Meme of ironic self-deconstruction typical of sensitivity and pluralistically inclusive systems of critical thought. I am an expression of the Second Tier collective, by the act of understanding and caring about Integral Theory, and that then motivates me to behaviorally teach it to others. </p><p data-v-7d4afa00> Each Altitude Level builds technology, systems of organization, physical and political infrastructure, and the next meme simply builds on top of it. Our network of communications technology, including internet, web, mobile, and social media emerged as the technological base of the Green Meme. A Level of the LR will be recognized as a fundamental shift in the technological paradigm. Thus, Orange introduced technologies that help us to measure and calculate the physical world, a democratic social system that maximizes personal liberty and responsibility, and enormous innovations to increase productivity, scale, scope, and efficiency of industry. Green brings us technology to communicate and connect globally, to express, to judge, to influence. The technology of Teal meme should be expected to emerge as tools, infrastructure, and organizational frameworks that reflect an awareness of Levels of development, such as perhaps a non-commercial web site that teaches Integral Theory. </p><h3 data-v-7d4afa00>LR Applications</h3><p data-v-7d4afa00> The LR orientation is suited to inductive reasoning, or Jung&#39;s thinking function. It thus manifests a sort of mastermind, diplomat, or executive character. This person is ideally suited for playing high stakes roles and making difficult decisions, as they are less influenceable and sensitive to interpersonal outcomes due to their objectivity and understanding of the occasion&#39;s ultimate insignificance.

holonic inclusion. These should align with any measure of overall human development, or Line, and possibly any specific measure of developmental ability. This is not Spiral Dynamics, though it expresses the same natural pattern, and some presentation elements. Ken Wilber considers Spiral Dynamics an expression of the Values Line, and Altitudes to be an overall developmental Level basis. We present Wilber&#39;s concepts differently from how he does, but this is his current Levels model. We have renamed the Levels to reflect concepts of reality at that Level. </p><h3 data-v-693ccd17>UL Lines Demonstration</h3><p data-v-693ccd17> Try out a sample. Measure your Altitudes. Don&#39;t worry, nobody is watching. This is between you and yourself. You may consider &quot;Your&quot; Level by the criteria of what you Think, Feel, Do, or an average of the three. We consider the Think Line very liberal for defining people overall, and the Do Line relatively conservative. In any event, an honest self-concept will yield few surprises. <span class="pedantic" data-v-693ccd17>Look at each Altitude, and one by one, determine if you express that Level with each of the three Lines in your ordinary, everyday life, most of the time. </span></p><p data-v-693ccd17><b data-v-693ccd17>Think: </b>Does this stage make sense to you?

The Spiral Dynamics Values Line model was a progenitor of Altitudes, coming from the mostly business-related efforts of researchers Don Beck and Christopher Cowan, adapted from the academic research of Clare Graves. Altitudes does not define a particular Line, it instead attempts to generalize the core pattern which appears regardless of the Line or Quadrant under consideration. </p><p data-v-693ccd17> The Third Tier Levels, similarly, result from a survey of mystical and transpersonal sources, finding base conceptual overlap between advanced consciousness methodologies and wisdom insights all around the world and all throughout history. </p><h2 data-v-693ccd17>Define Healthy, Mature, and Adult</h2><p data-v-693ccd17>A funny thing happens when you study human development. You try and define maturity, and no matter what you say, you find empirically that most &quot;adults&quot; are technically still at the measured stages considered appropriate for children. Unless you are talking about skeletons, graying, pubes, and physical effects of aging. If you look at personality, abilities, or intellect, you find that age is positively correlated with development, but the vast majority of &quot;adults&quot; are the same as children in terms of their maturity. </p><h2 data-v-693ccd17>The Reality of the Situation</h2><p data-v-693ccd17>In America right now, Red Meme is considered childish and immature, while everyone Amber and above is granted the dignity of being an adult (Orange then attacks Amber belief as &quot;childish&quot; while still considering them mature adults.) There is no formal recognition of a change in maturity from Amber to Orange to Green, but these perspectives are commonly believed to be matters of choice, preference, or upbringing. In other words, we conceptualize Levels as a horizontal Type system, ignoring the fact of directionality over time and that skipping Levels doesn&#39;t happen because it isn&#39;t mechanically possible. Green Meme is often considered youthful, naive, or immature, even though it is the highest Level commonly recognized by developmental theorists, and always appears after Amber and Orange developmentally. Amber and Orange call everything childish or wrong that does not agree with them. This is the monumental advance of Green Meme: it doesn&#39;t dismiss everything it disagrees with as childish and stupid - which is less childish and stupid, so more mature. </p><h2 data-v-693ccd17>Terminology</h2><p data-v-693ccd17>Levels might be called different names in a given context to reflect various aspects. <b data-v-693ccd17>Levels</b> is popular, but <b data-v-693ccd17>stages</b> seems prefered because it feels more natural to say. In the current system, the term <b data-v-693ccd17>Altitudes</b> emphasizes verticality and progression. In the Spiral Dynamics Level system, they are called value <b data-v-693ccd17>memes</b> (vMemes), refering to the Richard Dawkins memetic notion that conceptual ideas exhibit evolutionary mechanics similar to the way DNA replicates in biological evolution, and because SD studies the Values developmental Line. Calling Levels <b data-v-693ccd17>waves</b> emphasizes their oscillating, fluid dynamic, rising and falling like mysterious tides across the gradient spectrum of consciousness, as opposed to discrete stages that a person clicks into and never backslides, stagnates, or plateaus. </p><h3 data-v-693ccd17>The Levels of All Lines in All Quadrants</h3><p data-v-693ccd17><b data-v-693ccd17>UL: </b>Levels match and resemble classic Piaget stages of Cognitive Line development, or really, most stage systems. You should see the broad sketch of your own life in the chart, arriving somewhere around the top of the First Tier in general. For more spiritual thinkers, you may recognize the Third Tier from meditative, mystical, and contemplative traditions. You may see the overlap of Altitudes with the tree of life, Buddhism, or yogic chakras. </p><p data-v-693ccd17><b data-v-693ccd17>UR: </b>These Levels express the overall technological paradigm of any tool, item, artifact, or system. An architect applies Altitudes to their ideas of how to design buildings. We find ourselves in an era of history clearly characterized by digital media, internet, mobile phones, smart devices, web, social media, and more recently AI personalities and encyclopedias. These devices are connected to, plugged into, an overall Green Meme tech base. In the Industrial, steam locomotive era, a cellphone would be largely meaningless, as the parts to make the parts to make the parts could not be made without significant advances. Similarly, imagine time traveling somehow to the paleolithic, Infrared era. You know what a gun is, basically, and it would be nice to have one. How could you do it? </p><p data-v-693ccd17><b data-v-693ccd17>LL: </b>Altitudes are moral value positions and political parties. Also, personal identity affiliations, relationship roles, and membership. All of the people you meet, your friends and enemies, family and strangers, all of their thoughts and feelings, their motives, their interests, their personality and drives, all of these Lines express Levels. Entertainment, media, literature, music, all arise from Altitudes, tracing the history of literature and artistic expression, providing an essential and universal contextual framework. </p><p data-v-693ccd17><b data-v-693ccd17>LR: </b>Students of history, economics, or any social science will recognize these as stages of world civilization, going through the same progression of major paradigm shifts as the human individual, the same basic descriptors apply to the collective. These are the global paradigms of the human collective and all of its endeavors. </p><h3 data-v-693ccd17>The Ultimate Hack Job</h3><p data-v-693ccd17> It can be argued that Third Tier stages are unrelated to the first and second tier Levels, or loosely related, and so stacking perrenial spiritual wisdom of a supposed third tier atop the Levels discovered with entirely different methodologies may seem disingenuous or unfounded. </p><p data-v-693ccd17>On the other enormous hand, a developmentalist using only the first and second tier Levels will have no way to describe, conceptualize, or account for transpersonal States and the glaringly obvious fact that Waking Up is a developmental path with Levels to the progression that behave unmistakeably like the Levels of Growing Up, and result in sentiments, cognition, and capacities that seem categorically improved in many ways. </p><p data-v-693ccd17>Integral may perhaps represent the first clear, comprehensible, formidable, and valid attempt to reconcile these two fundamental quests of the human spirit. Conventional developmentalists are unconcerned with spirituality and enlightenment, while spiritual masters may advance theories that include lower Levels but miss subtleties and nuances that are less the concern of their approach. Typically, these works lack the professional polish and clear presentation of conventional and commercial models, requiring a vast amount of study and cultural familiarity to translate the work into what it simply means. </p><h3 data-v-693ccd17>Welcome to Second Tier! \u{1F44B}\u{1F3FF}</h3><p data-v-693ccd17>If you&#39;re reading this, and it makes sense to you, that means that cognitively, at the Level of how you Think, you are at least stage 7 Teal Meme. It&#39;s not a contest, as you know. What this means is that there is no world for you, there is no tech base. It&#39;s just us. We&#39;re Second Tier poineers, because not comprehending reality is a clear and present threat to civilization. I hope that we can all work together in an Integral meshwork, because Altitudes shows how Integral can address that issue. We develop it. </p><h3 data-v-693ccd17>The Integral Developer</h3><p data-v-693ccd17> Development starts with conceptualizing and talking about a meme. <b data-v-693ccd17>Think</b> it. <b data-v-693ccd17>Feel</b> comes much later for most people, where you start to genuinely ask yourself whether this theory actually describes <em data-v-693ccd17>this</em> reality, and whether that motivates you to decide things that are illuminated for you with this perspective (making it a useful tool by any stretch), to come into alignment with your various selves and your highest and most positive aspects, to Upgrade to the latest stable human operating system: to Wake Up, Clean Up, and Grow Up in All Quadrants. </p><h3 data-v-693ccd17>Altitudes Are Holons</h3><p data-v-693ccd17> The holonic nature of Memes (Altitudes) might not be clear at first. So let us examine how Memes are holons, whole-parts, or they transcend but include shallower Memes into themselves. </p><p data-v-693ccd17> The development of people, civilization, culture, and technology, all function in the same way that cells enfold molecules enfold atoms. The same way that paragraphs enfold sentences enfold words enfold letters, each at its own level and scale, with its own rules. A complex motor includes many simple wedges, levers, and inclined planes. A progressive contemporary painting includes techniques and themes developed in isolation over the course of art history. </p><h3 data-v-693ccd17>Mind From Instinct</h3><p data-v-693ccd17>Level 1 Infrared is simply the instinctual patterns of cognition and behavior which occur to our body in nature as roving packs of homo sapiens with fire and sticks, and the full Infrared range can be considered to stretch back into monkeys and shrews and lizards and fish. The language revolution is of key interest. In the UR, the unit or currency of evolution went from biological DNA to memetic self-concept. The new evolution is concepts, culture, technology, and legal systems. </p><h3 data-v-693ccd17>People From Animals</h3><p data-v-693ccd17> From DNA replication and natural selection of instinct, to ideological replication and social innovation of memes, there is a smooth transition in the Level stack that often goes unnoticed. Life changed the kosmic evolution vehicle from physical and chemical processes to the processes of biological life. Each at its own Level and scale, with its own dynamics. If we take the electromagnetic spectrum metaphor to extremes, Levels extend down to the microwave range, the cellular, and the radio ranges of chemical molecular levels, the physical atomic, and so on. Just as they likely will extend upward into super-conscious planetary AI motherbrain, or interdimensional kosmic alignment, or whatever is next up there in the cosmic rays. </p><h3 data-v-693ccd17>Mind Level 2</h3><p data-v-693ccd17> In the transition to language and culture of Magenta, the vehicle of kosmic evolution transformed from instinct to conceptual language. Just as atoms are enfolded in molecules are enfolded in cells, holonically, Magenta is a conscious cluster of instincts with a tendency to communicate, enfolded in a magical fantasy self concept resulting from communication. That was the point when everything changed. You gave it a Name. Logos. Of course, in real life, nothing actually changed. This could all continue to be described in the UR as brainwaves, but we lack the sophistication, and ideas are easier to describe from the inside... with language. </p><h3 data-v-693ccd17>Instant Replay</h3><p data-v-693ccd17> Somehow, magically \u{1FA84}, instinct to communicate becomes an entirely new Meme of vocal sounds that stand for realities. Various instincts have predisposed us to have this capacity to convert ideas into words and then shape them with our mouths and speak them to one another and then hear and comprehend what was said. Great, it talks. Ask it what reality is. </p><h3 data-v-693ccd17>Magenta Reality</h3><p data-v-693ccd17> It is lore. Everything I know is what my local village tells me. As societies grow and organize into Red, the lore becomes assembled by authorities into only the most superlative, ultimate, epic lore, and that is legend. Understand here, literally, I am legend. We are legend. The world is legend. Read what the ancient Greeks and Egyptians had to say about reality. They proudly present tall tales of great deeds that speak of the tragedy and foils of experience. </p><h3 data-v-693ccd17>Instinct -&gt; Lore -&gt; Legend -&gt; Myth</h3><p data-v-693ccd17> Sooner or later, the legendary assembler of legend encounters the greatest story ever told, the perfect story that requires no embellishment. The God spell. In comes the axial period, the Amber wave, the religious order, the absolutist, the member, and what is the Bible, for example? It starts with a collection of the most important legends. Myth is a collection of ultimate legends, all serving the central purpose of fully explaining reality to everyone. </p><h3 data-v-693ccd17>Simple As It Seems</h3><p data-v-693ccd17> The religious order educates some priviledged myth members to teach and spread religion effectively. The educated class becomes privy to truths and methods which shed doubt on the mythic tradition, which are perhaps more compelling than bureaucratic dogma. They don&#39;t start society over just yet. Everyone in the world doesn&#39;t suddenly realize they know nothing but wish-fulfilling myth and reject all prior knowledge. They laboriously challenge and scrutinize their assumptions, picking them apart with reason, logic, and science. </p><h3 data-v-693ccd17>Rationality Orders Myth</h3><p data-v-693ccd17> When we became a Stage 5 democratic nation, we did not burn all mythic literature and forbid religious thinking, as that methodology would reflect Stage 4. We retained our traditions, calling them cultural mythology instead of absolute truth. Transcend and include. Society and knowledge succesfully existed before rationality. We are historically and statistically not rational by nature. Rational social order is a centuries-old (extremely recent) emergence. Science doesn&#39;t properly discover new truths, they check whether new truths are true. Rationality arises by testing and collecting those myths which prove true, discarding those which prove irrational or non-productive. </p><h3 data-v-693ccd17>The Integral Revolution</h3><p data-v-693ccd17>Just as we beg our audience to not receive Integral as a religious myth, we also insist that the emergence of Second Tier should not expect to look anything like any prior Level. Bloody social revolt is clearly characteristic of lower Levels. If you are Teal and want to know what the revolution looks like, just ask yourself what you would do, and if it isn&#39;t being done, do it. \u{1F44B}\u{1F3FF} Hi. </p><h3 data-v-693ccd17>And Voila!</h3><p data-v-693ccd17>Reality is a stack of Levels in four Quadrants.

Theory</b>. <span class="pedantic"> Top buttons allow you to browse the <b>5 Modules: Quadrants, Levels, Lines, Types,</b> and <b>States.</b></span></p><h2>Consciousness in Five Words</h2><h3>Reality

class="hilight">S</span>tates } </h3><p>The five factors of this Theory of Everything should feel familiar and largely intuitive as we go along. </p><img class="integral-banner" src="'+xi+'"><p></p><h3>Integral Theory (what is this?)</h3><p> This is not trademarked guru secrets, but a free map of extremely popular, accepted, and well-known ideas. They make no falsifiable, ontological claims, other than suggesting a categorization framework. This is not an ideology. There is no belief, no leader, no interest. It&#39;s just an extremely useful categorization schema for humans today, quite commonsense. We prefer to use Integral in the absense of alternatives. </p><h3>The Nature of Integral</h3><p> Like the profound works of Freud, Jung, Einstein, Neitzche, and Marx, this should best be considered exploratory, adapatable, open-ended, and interpretive. It is not pop psychology, nor is it new age spiritualism or occultism. It is not pseudo-science. It just isn&#39;t science. It&#39;s not religion, though it includes <em>all of these</em>, as it is a complete philosophy of reality and consciousness. The colorful little words in the diagram can be thought of as &quot;lenses,&quot; or primary factors generating the reality that we experience, and the structural dynamics of the kosmos. </p><h3>Second Tier Reality</h3><p> Integral Theory is a tentatively complete philosophical system, so &quot;Integral&quot; simultaneously refers to Wilber&#39;s work or any expression of Integral Levels or similar methodology. A <a href="https://www.stuartdavis.com/blog/creating-language" style="display:inline;text-decoration:none;color:teal;" target="_blank">language</a> can be Integral. Even a <a href="/time" target="_blank" style="display:inline;text-decoration:none;color:teal;">clock</a> can be Integral. </p><h3>AQALALATAS</h3><p> The complicated diagram attempts to encapsulate and define an Integral, or Second Tier, perspective, which is the most advanced <b>Level</b> of consciousness recognized today by a general survey of developmental psychology literature focusing on overall stage trends. And there it is: the Teal map of reality, totally naked and complicated because that&#39;s how Teal likes to do things. Are you as excited as I am? \u{1F603} </p><h1>Integral Theory</h1><p>Author Ken Wilber has made a career out of writing sophisticated and accessible books covering the vast reaches of this mind-expanding approach to philosophy, and continues in advanced age to appear in various podcasts and talks, continuing to develop new ways of expressing these ideas. His various institutes and academic programs offer superior resources. Stein unLimited has found this theory so useful, helpful, profound, and unnoticed, that a large part of our mission is teaching these ideas in our own way, because we felt like it would be cool of us. </p><h3>Integral Thinking</h3><p>Integral is not just the presentation or usage of these concepts. It is properly the process of arriving at them. This is not the place for a biography of Ken Wilber, but he arrived somewhat decisively at a basic Integral Theory through intense research, spiritual practice, and a process of trying to organize fundamental notions and trends in philosophy. </p><h3>The Ken Wilber Process</h3><p> With developmental psychology, this was achieved by laying out all existing models (some interpretation necessary) and observing that they all trace different aspects of a person, and for different purposes, but the overlap is unmistakable. The overlap itself generates a stage model, Altitudes. And then you see that the Altitudes not only apply to individuals, the same general patterns characterize civilization, history, the way society is structured, everything everyone creates, everything everyone does, the reasons that we do what we do, and the relative nature of our own current perspective in the grand scope of available perspectives. </p><p> Wilber organized his own vision of consciousness, reality, and the mind, into the Five Modules (AQALALATAS). As we return to the more ordinary deductive, social, and procedural realities that we mostly face, we now have a map of the infinite possibilities and perspectives available at all times. </p><h3>What Does the Word Integral Actually Mean?</h3><p>Commonly, integral indicates something is an important part or necessary aspect of a whole. Integral Theory asks, what are the important parts or necessary aspects of reality? What are the important parts or necessary aspects of answering that question, about anything? How can I tell whether anyone can answer that question? Relationships between whole and part characterize the entire conceptual mechanic and operational fulcrum of the theory (as explored in the Quadrants section), which is why Wilber and notable others have converged on the term Integral. </p><h3>Calculus</h3><p>In mathematics, the integral is a sort of function which generalizes other functions under consideration, enabling another level of insights and enhanced calculation potential. As with Integral Theory, generalizing here does not so much suggest omitting detail or diversity, but more suggests including the abstraction of commonality and trends from a transcendent meta or collective perspective. This sort of inductive meta-path yields archetypal patterns, dynamics, and mechanics which comprise an astoundingly elegant and comprehensive model of reality. It includes the material universe, this experience, consciousness, perspectives, the unconscious, and the unknown. </p><h3>Integral Level</h3><p> Integral Theory is a system of generalizations that can be used as basic orientation points across professional fields, cultures, and contexts to ensure an Integral Level standard of perspective inclusion. In a survey of psychological concepts and models of consciousness, Wilber discovered that Integral was a commonly used term to describe this emerging Level of consciousness, meaning system holistic and heirarchically inclusive, also dialectical. In a parallel of central significance and influence to the Wilberian perspective, the theoretical advances of eastern mystic Sri Aurobindo were also self-termed Integral Yoga. </p><h3>Transcend and Include</h3><p>Higher, deeper, more evolved, developed, or inclusive, do not necessarily mean personally or morally superior, wise, mature, or smart. There&#39;s nothing smarter, more lovable or blameless, than a newborn baby. The purpose of the baby isn&#39;t to grow up, grow old, and die. The baby is an end in itself. So says a moral Level far beyond a baby&#39;s comprehension, and thus it becomes the responsibility of the higher Level to make sure the baby&#39;s diapers get changed. It becomes your responsibility, quite naturally, to try and get the baby up a few Levels, so you no longer have to take care of the things the baby is unaware of that are problematic for both of you.</p><p>If moving up Levels means any one thing, it means greater responsibility. The challenge is not to get to the highest Level, or even the next Level. The challenge arises from the intuitive nature of this developmental heirarchy and recognizing where your primary expressions exist within it.</p><h3>We&#39;re Expecting More of Us \u{1F63A}</h3><p>Wilber provides a philosophical groundwork, a manifesto, or just introduction to the Integral Level, but the Level arises in nature, and the word Integral will most likely forever be nothing more than a reference to his books. Whether or not the Integral Level identifies itself with Wilber, for our purposes, it is most important just to judge the plausibility of these ideas, and observe that the integral Level which exists in reality is mostly unaware of Wilber and Integral Theory. We wanted to try using this framework self-consciously and conspicuously, see how fluent we can become with it, what it may reveal to us, and what effects it might have on our lives. </p><h3>Hey, This Is Like Some Other Thing...</h3><p> It is. The Five Modules are entirely matter-of-fact observations and concepts we use intuitively in today&#39;s world. Insights pertaining to spirituality apply equally to all religious, spiritual, and atheist or agnostic perspectives. Wilber&#39;s work is a grand synthesis; practically no aspect of it is entirely original, and nearly everything represented in this model derives from the overlap of numerous common sources What is unique and creative to Wilber&#39;s work is his selection, curation, and framing of these academic, literary, and esoteric sources, the way he organizes and categorizes them, and the pioneering scope of his entire articulated vision. </p><h3>Physics and A Theory of Everything</h3><p> There is a common conception that fundamental particles, waves, or field dynamics in physics, as the building blocks, or structural essence, of reality, perhaps even the thoughts of God, should reveal everything we need to know about the nature of reality. &quot;Theory of Everything&quot; canonically refers to a theory uniting relativity and quantum theory. This is a conservative appraisal of &quot;everything,&quot; leaning heavily towards extremely large and small things. Since Integral Theory includes material reality, and also consciousness and culture (which are real but do not have mass, charge, volume, or spin), Integral is a better contender for Theory of Everything, if anyone still wants to fight about it. \u{1F94A} </p><h3>Integral Particle Physics</h3><p> Reality is not merely a massive heap of protons, neutrinos, leptons, etc., but those particles stack and organize at various Levels: neutrons, atoms, molecules, cells, tissues, and each Level has unique dynamics and mechanics, all flexing and flowing operationally with one another, moving together. The nature of particles is of great interest to technology and philosophy. At every scale of size, the &quot;building blocks&quot; of that Level have their own novel, emergent structure and dynamics. The cells of my body each do their own thing, they all have their function, but also they &quot;integrate&quot; into my body. We discovered cells, and this opened up a new world of comprehending biology and medicine. We discovered genetics. The derivative of cells, step down a Level, and you find that cells are integral molecules. The periodic table yields the substance of reality. Of course, molecules are integral atoms, are integral subatomic particles, are integral quarks. We&#39;ll find reality. \u{1F44D}\u{1F3FF} Just keep digging. </p><h3>A Thing Made Out Of Things That Makes A Thing</h3><p> It&#39;s okay to talk about physics. Material and mental reality are both composed of Levels of holons, or whole entities unto themselves which exist as part of another entity, as far up and as far down as we have ever been able to see. These are holons, because whole atoms are parts of whole molecules, which are parts of whole cells. And I see you looking up towards the top of the stack of atoms and molecules and thinking, <b>what&#39;s the top Level?</b></p><h3>The Most Interesting Thing Anywhere</h3><p> Is it the Universe? The Meta-Versity? An embryo floating in space? Closer. You see, the Universe is very very big, and so I see how, after looking at very very small, you might think the other extreme. What is the Universe? It&#39;s not a bunch of this, far as we know. There&#39;s not a bunch of people in it. Nah, it&#39;s pretty much just tons and tons of lower Levels: particles, waves, molecules. These low Levels take up all of the physical space in the Universe. Low Levels exist everywhere, with extreme amounts of space between them, and they collectively form galaxies, stars, and planets. The very little compose the very big - not intelligent or self-aware or alive - just big, and relatively empty and unremarkable. It&#39;s very impressive, very vast, and as far as we know, there is nothing out there, in any of that, doing what&#39;s going on right here, where we marvel at its vastness and comprehend its meaning. It&#39;s you, my love. You are a higher Level than the galaxy. Molecules and stars aren&#39;t alive. And what&#39;s more, if you can but reach it, the highest Level in existence is pure integrated experience itself. </p><h3>Middle Way ftw</h3><p>Big and small are elusive frontiers, but normal-sized, or every-sized, is where you&#39;ll find higher Levels. Because, look at reality right now. The atoms, the molecules, they are being you and this environment, aren&#39;t they, and they are being experienced because You are here. Now, this is very relevant to you, being at your scale. You, too, are a holon. When I say You, what do I mean? I mean a concept (meme) that your body (brain(chemisty(waves))) generates. </p><h3>Evolving Self Concepts</h3><p> You ever think about who you really are? The self concept amalgam is a holon, perhaps made of rational or progressive self concept memes. These could potentially form a higher Level self concept holon by integrating with other holons. </p><p> Nevertheless, the self concept is composed of memetic conceptual holons, which developed from more immature or simple memes, made of holons made of holons made of holons, until you get to instinct. </p><h3>The Evolving Stack</h3><p> Inevitably, the self concept must have arisen from instinct. What is this thing we call instinct? It must be a form of consciousness that we share with the animals, but it is a lower Level of consciousness, and clearly so, as they are not self aware. If we want to know how what instinct is made of, or what it is, we can look at how it comes to be as a human sperm and egg transform into any old human baby, or we can look at how our structure evolved biologically as we were shaped from the primate meme from the mammal meme from the vertebrate meme from the animal meme from the life meme. </p><p> These memes have developed from the trial and error of reproduction and death, but as you can see, the laboratory of life shows us, though it is abstract, that life evolves just like self concepts, by integrating more primitive structural concepts into higher-Level structural concepts, because higher Levels, though more fragile, offer enormous survival advantages under ideal conditions (higher Levels are overpowered and transformative, but increasingly brief and unstable). </p><h3>Any Old Baby is a Masterpiece of DNA</h3><p> Over the history of Earth, life underwent a sort of overall memetic transformation, or meta-evolution, or we can say the phylogeny of consciousness. Tracing history over the vast stretches of geological time, it is clear that emergent biological structures come to dominate the food chain, then to become the basis of future emergence, often in association with cataclismic global changes. </p><h3>Ontogeny Recapitulates Phylogeny</h3><p> These emergent holon structures (organ systems, essentially), when taken over the total span of evolution in an arguably abstract sense, map out the primary divisions of taxonomical systems. The same sequence of structural emergence occurs within the womb during pregnancy, and the embryonic infant oddly mirrors the general structure of each creature leading up to homo sapiens, as these structures were largely built atop of, starting from the Level of chemical proteins, which started the whole thing in either case. </p><h3>Life to Mind Levels (Infrared and Visible Light)</h3><p> Genetic holons, over the history of our species from the primordial ooze, evolved the advanced organs that enable symbolic social communication. From here, evolution is no longer at the Level of biological Life, and the holonic unit switches from instinct holons to mental conceptual holons. </p><h3>Any Old Baby is a Cave Person</h3><p> The baby must learn through communication everything that has occured in history (of civilization and thought, or the Level of Mind), but this is also the human superpower, as any old baby can pick up where every old dead person left off. Physical Matter, substance, and genetic Life have culminated in memetic Mind, and at this Level, the scale of a life is for once quite meaningful. </p><h3>The Spectrum is One Process</h3><p> Perhaps more interesting than discovering the smallest thing that makes up all things and the rules that apply to it&#39;s impossibly tiny Level, we can trace a continuous spectrum, just like the electromagnetic spectrum we use as a Levels analogy, from the Big Bang of tiny stuff burning through space in the Universe, to the emergence of life on Earth, to the rise of civilization, to the present day and perhaps the Future. </p><p> In the grand analogy of Integral Theory, we refer to this with the metaphor of an electromagnetic spectrum of Levels, with Matter and Substance in the Radio range, Life in the Microwave and Infrared, Mind Levels (Altitudes) in the Visible Light rainbow, and leaving plenty of room for evolution in the diverse bands of cosmic rays. It is a great metaphor in many ways, particularly in that Integral pursues integrating perspectives on the visible, or known, rather than extremes, or the unkown. It is all about recognizing where perspectives show up relative to other perspectives. </p><h3>Reality-Assembling Memes As Colors</h3><p> As we focus in closer to home, closer to now, at the Level of Mind and social memetic interaction, we enter the visible light range, the reality that we can actually see first-hand. Just more Levels of holons stacking ever higher. And hopefully you are starting to see now that if you play your cards right, you have the potential to be the highest stack of holons that exists in the known Universe. For all you know, you are already as high as shit stacks, but Second Tier is telling you there&#39;s higher. It&#39;s inward. Even closer to home. Always closer, always effortless after the fact. </p><p> It is more true to say your physical body is a stack of holonic Levels, than to say that it is a collection of organs, a bunch of carbon, water, and protein, a story of a woman named &quot;Stevie,&quot; or the vibrations of eleventh dimensional super-strings. These would be single-Level perspectives on the self. </p><h2>The Nature of Reality</h2><p>As a through-line, consider the question, &quot;What is reality?&quot; Consider asking all the people you walk past, you work with, all the people you know, all around the world, the great thinkers and famous minds all throughout history. <b>What&#39;s real?</b> How could you organize <em>all of that</em> into a simple expression of what is? And faced with each of these people, what would you say, if you had to explain it all? This presentation should be for everybody, for a kid, for an alien, for grandma, for someone exactly like me. </p><h3>The Mental Prison&#39;s Blueprints</h3><p> The Integral framework is a global put-in point, a most-zoomed-out view possible: an entire map of reality as understood by humans. It tells you not only what you already know, but what else there is. It&#39;s not the content of who you are or what you think, it&#39;s just an optimized set of containers. The containers are not traps, they are developmental opportunities with apparent growth vectors. </p><h3>A Fingerprint of Wisdom</h3><p>In each Module, we explore a core pattern of nature and mind, and this may be considered &quot;spiritual,&quot; as it pertains to topics that are termed that way. We gladly embrace and re-own this term, but with the note that this comes from a place of utmost empirical skepticism towards belief systems. The Integral spirituality is not magic and myth, and requires no faith. For those who are spiritual, we hope that Integral will help to lend context and conceptual support to your experiences and beliefs. We as a brand consciously own and embrace our own versions of magic and myth, and find them to be healthy and valuable within their domain. The majority of what is considered spiritual in this context pertains to permanent changes to a person&#39;s regular brain functioning and felt sense of reality and identity, usually as the result of meditative practices. These practices are commonly associated with and best upheld by religious traditions. </p><h3>Positive Medicine</h3><p> Integral tends to focus more on defining health rather than illness, but if you are interested in the How and Why of mental illness, all five modules contribute substantially to modeling patterns of illness, often termed Allergy and Fixation. Fixation or addiction would suggest an unhealthy allocation of consciousness to a particular Level, Quadrant, or Line, for example, to the exclusion of the others, creating a blind spot. If I focus exclusively on the UL Quadrant and completely shut out or can&#39;t comprehend any others, this will produce pathological behavior. </p><h3>Integral Health</h3><p>Integral Health is expressed as openness, acceptance, and non-attachment to particular Levels, Quadrants, Lines, etc. Allergy would be the opposite, a total rejection or unconsciousness towards a particular Integral feature, or several. Altitudes all express some degree of Fixation in their current Level, and some degree of Allergy to all other Levels, particularly the immediately previous. Gods of the previous religion become devils of the new. The First Tier is fundamentally unhealthy in today&#39;s world by today&#39;s standards, because it is unconscious of Levels, pretending hard Levels don&#39;t exist, which makes it seem like the motives and values of others are just some incomprehensible mystery box. There are a lot of Levels out there in the world today, and <em>most people are not at your Level,</em> no matter which one it is. Frustrating. Eternal frustration is unhealthy, in Integral. </p><h3>Cleaning Up</h3><p> In Integral, these can be called the Jungian term Shadow, and the positive (as opposed to clinical) role of therapies is to Clean Up the Shadow elements of your consciousness, which means integrating them with consciousness. To be crystal clear, the work of Cleaning Up is somewhat unrelated to the work of Growing Up (Levels) and Waking Up (States), which means that you can still be quite neurotic or pathological, we prefer &quot;unhealthy&quot;, while expressing </p>',77),Li=[Ii];function _i(y,h){return o(),r("div",Ti,Li)}var zi=W(ki,[["render",_i]]);const

a momentary snapshot of all information under consideration. States are a factor in All Quadrants at All Levels. You can have a state of public panic, a data state in software, a cellular metabolism state, etc, but here we are talking mostly about the UL view. In consciousness, States include things like sensations, thoughts, feelings, moods, perceptions, attitudes, and personal affinities. The map above displays All States that you can be conscious of, illustrating the relationship between Ordinary States and a generalized progression of meditative Spiritual realizations, mapping objective brainwave patterns (electroencephalograph, EEG) to the described subjective experience. </p><h3 data-v-783e9179>A Galaxy Within</h3><p data-v-783e9179> The Integral Level recognizes colloquial, everyday States like hunger, fear, worry, and irritation. We call these <b data-v-783e9179>Ordinary</b> States. Psychology and medicine give us outstanding tools for decoding these felt and communicated State experiences. Mental and emotional States are commonly assessed and defined by doctors and psychologists. Many outstanding models and descriptions define the range and variety of Ordinary States, as well as neurotic and pathological States according to symptom Types (diagnostic criteria). </p><h3 data-v-783e9179>Dilated Me</h3><p data-v-783e9179> Nearly everyone in the world will observe that we are conscious of Gross reality as Ego with various Personalities, we mostly are unconscious during Theta Dreaming, and certainly unconscious in Delta Sleep. This is true of almost everyone not engaged with an effective and well-informed long term Spiritual Practice. That&#39;s not a diss at all. We&#39;re nearly everyone who ever lived and we don&#39;t know what reality tastes like. It&#39;s okay. \u{1FAF6}\u{1F3FF} True wisdom is knowing that we know nothing. But hey... can we at least <em data-v-783e9179>listen</em> to the people who <em data-v-783e9179>have</em> done the work? Is it okay to talk about this? </p><h3 data-v-783e9179>Spiritual... \u{1F626}</h3><p data-v-783e9179>We don&#39;t mean Magenta magic, Red cults, or Amber mythic membership. The spirit of a thing is its fundamental overall nature, not a force ghost. We name the spirit of everything God as that&#39;s the word in English. We set out to comprehend reality. What is the spirit of everything? What is the fundamental nature of consciousness, the essence of this now? Religions call that thing a name, and they have a relationship with it. </p><h3 data-v-783e9179>Dharma</h3><p data-v-783e9179> You may hesitate to use names. Regardless, in this moment you either experience Spirit directly, in a transcendental State, or you don&#39;t. It is easy to think that you understand what these silly words mean. It seems easy to imitate and paraphrase, as I do. It&#39;s also easy to access transcendental States. You can&#39;t experience union while currently being an ego with personalities, reacting against all these various concepts. You&#39;re doomed. \u26B0\uFE0F </p><h3 data-v-783e9179>Transcendental Consciousness</h3><p data-v-783e9179> We are most interested in States that contribute to our mission of comprehending reality. Our comprehension passes through, is generated by, whatever State we&#39;re in. If I have never worked on this, or thought about it before, probably I am not in the most sober, open, clear-headed State possible. I probably don&#39;t even know how to define what I&#39;m assessing. As we pursue this question, we encounter mystical writings, and meditation. It is pre-rational mythology. We leave. \u{1F6AA} </p><h3 data-v-783e9179>Rational Mysticism</h3><p data-v-783e9179>We come back. \u{1F6AA} There is something <em data-v-783e9179>to</em> all of this. By controlling the attention, we can see and understand more clearly, more deeply, into the abstract and the unconscious. We can Wake Up. This will require practice, and likely guidance from someone who has already been through training. Our only advice on finding effective teaching is that you should put at least as much care into this decision as you would into marrying someone. With effort and time, practice may ultimately grant access to the full States spectrum, and you begin entering different mental configurations, experienced transpersonally as realms, or bodies. Spiritual States can feel unbelievably different from Ordinary, and reveal primary, key, inexpressible truths about reality. </p><h3 data-v-783e9179>Spiritual States</h3><p data-v-783e9179>Sources throughout history describe elusive States of consciousness called enlightment, peak experience, religious or mystical or spiritualized states (the content is whatever you believe in), trances, visions, prophecies, disembodiedness, communion with God, oneness with everything, channeling various projected entities, nonduality. These states are often regarded as epiphany or breakthrough, and may result in major positive changes to worldview, attitude, and behavior. The range, scope, wisdom, and influence of these sources is enormous, including medical reports and modern journalism. The causes and veracity of these State claims is unclear, and eternally debated. </p><h3 data-v-783e9179>Comparative Religion</h3><p data-v-783e9179>A sorely needed project of Integral is to foster understanding, communication, and interplay between the adherents of various values and beliefs. We point out the great strength of the religious traditions with States. We point out the deficiencies with Levels. Integral honors the supreme value of the esoteric visions underlying holy scriptures, and it makes no excuses for the inexcusable. We encourage the religious to examine what Level your community expresses, and to express your religion at the Level you actually are. We embrace several, including atheism. For atheists, we challenge you to examine the science of meditation, and seriously try spiritual practice. </p><h3 data-v-783e9179>Great Nest of Being \u{1FABA}</h3><p data-v-783e9179> Integral observes a perennial wisdom, or core content that is central to every spiritual perspective. Our map is one way to iterate it: Personality, Ego, Psyche, Consciousness. In the medieval Great Chain of nested realms of spiritual density, it is more like Matter, Body, Mind, Soul, Spirit. Various religions (in their esoteric interpretations) provide their own maps, and spell out the process, in the form of legend and myth most of the time. In the case of Therevada Buddhism, the instructions are quite straightforward and rational, like a manual. In Zen the instructions contradict themselves and break your mind. Many religions are not straightforward with their instructions because the documents were multi-purpose. </p><h3 data-v-783e9179>Mystery Revealed</h3><p data-v-783e9179> Our map gives the basic range of what variety of transcendent States can be experienced, regardless of whether you interpret it as ancestors or spirits or dieties or angels or psychic manifest content of the unconscious, or how we describe it here. Regardless of our Level, States are experienced by Ego as intense revelation, as death, as Ego reflects on its construction from Psyche from Consciousness. </p><h3 data-v-783e9179>Psychic States</h3><p data-v-783e9179>Early Psychic States are experienced as a sort of jailbreak. Prior to Psychic, you are configured with core assumptions that you are located at some point inside your body, at the center, the center is in the head, that this thing is my name, has my life story, is discrete from its environment, is moving through time, is at the center of space, is distant from distant memories, discrete from its parents, from its lovers, from the people it communicates with. Maybe you have some of those config settings, and maybe you don&#39;t. </p><h3 data-v-783e9179>You Believe Me Now? \u{1F928}</h3><p data-v-783e9179> Psychic States are often considered exciting, frightening, disturbing, life changing, highly cerebral, and there is a tendency to mythologize the content of these States, appropriately enough. Since this is the first realm, or the first depth, beyond Gross, Psychic States are somewhat common. These would generally fit the bill for the stories that spiritual people tell one another about mind-blowing &quot;religious states&quot; and such. That&#39;s mostly Psychic. An ordinary person could expect Psychic States within months of starting a daily one hour meditation practice. Alternately, they could read books on meditation and mimmick the gist of what they read, and it would be hard to tell the difference. </p><h3 data-v-783e9179>No Boundary</h3><p data-v-783e9179> As we learn to focus into slower, deeper, wider brainwaves, in meditation and ordinary life, we start to get in touch with the invisible Psyche. We begin to comprehend how we construct reality, this very reality, from archetypes, or extremely basic memetic associations. The Psyche exposes how Ego is imagining itself into being. This is disruptive, sometimes traumatic. Psychic mystics may struggle as the solidity of their boundaries dissolve, and they may need to isolate. The Nature Mystic is a classic example and archetype. </p><h3 data-v-783e9179>Subject/Object Duality</h3><p data-v-783e9179> My sense of being in here with an objective world out there is an idea that I learned, so long ago that it precedes my language and thinking. If I look very carefully, and abandon my assumptions, I see that it&#39;s just this one thing. Reality is nondual. There&#39;s not two things, or four things. Just this. </p><h3 data-v-783e9179>Light and Cave Thing \u{1F304}</h3><p data-v-783e9179> We experience only a portion of State reality: Ordinary, Waking, Gross, with all of its variety and diversity, all of its value. That is all we know, and we can&#39;t imagine the value of other State realms. It might have something to do with the feeling of unresolve, abandonment, antagonism, loneliness, emptiness, meaninglessness, that all mature people know. Dim cave, no idea what&#39;s out there. I can describe it all day, but let&#39;s go out there, or we&#39;ll never comprehend. </p><h3 data-v-783e9179>Ego Dilemma</h3><p data-v-783e9179>Face facts. We don&#39;t get it. I don&#39;t know who I am, or what I should do. I&#39;m futile, mortal Ego. I&#39;m doomed to lose everything, suffer, be betrayed, die. I don&#39;t deserve anything I have. Tick tick tick. Going to hell someday. Oh, it burns now. Those Noble Truths. You Wake Up and everything is gone. Everything that mattered. So you thought. But someone tugged on your arm. You shook yourself. Something woke you up. Who did you think it was? If it was a snake, it would have bit you. If you haven&#39;t been bitten, you will be. The bell tolls. </p><h3 data-v-783e9179>Is This The End?</h3><p data-v-783e9179>Not at all. Simply relating some Noble Truths. The Light. The Way. Good News. There is a path beyond ego to States of consciousness which enormously relieve the concerns of Ego, simply by being more aware of reality. There are many ways to arrive at States. We recommend meditation, as this is the purpose of it, and it&#39;s effective. As you experience States, it becomes easier to relate to discussions of Psychic, Subtle, Causal, and Nondual, and you no longer need Integral Theory. </p><h3 data-v-783e9179>Why Enlightenment?</h3><p data-v-783e9179> Enlightenment does not cure sorrow, pain, or death. It hurts more. You like it more. Imagine fearlessness. Already dead, never born. No problems. This is You. Freedom and fullness. It&#39;s all made up. This is a love that touches you, hurts bad for a long time, takes away everything, makes you live forever devoted, and see that it was always your choice. Inspiration and growth, Eros, and her Shadow, death and fear, Thanatos. Reflected Integral dieties, \u{1F9EC}ascending and \u{1F494}descending, beckoning you to recognize the path, follow the map, reach the conclusion. They lived happily ever after. It is perfectly acceptable, ordinary, moral, and reasonable to have insufficient or no interest in the path. Just don&#39;t pretend there isn&#39;t a path. We&#39;re already here. </p><h3 data-v-783e9179>\u{1F9D8}\u{1F3FF}\u{1F9D8}\u{1F3FD}\u200D\u2640\uFE0F\u{1F9D8}\u{1F3FC}\u{1F9D8}\u{1F3FB}\u{1F9D8}\u{1F3FF}\u200D\u2642\uFE0F\u{1F9D8}\u{1F9D8}\u{1F3FC}\u{1F9D8}\u{1F3FF}\u200D\u2642\uFE0F</h3><p data-v-783e9179> Meanwhile, I dare suggest we spend twenty minutes a day sitting and paying attention to Being, reducing stress, relaxing body and emotions, affirming ourselves, tuning in, practicing being more awake and aware all the time, increasing our intelligence and lifespan. Integral&#39;s primary goal is not to teach spiritual practice, but first to suggest a map of the territory under discussion. This is the frustrating ultimate fact of the matter with Integral Theory. Thinking doesn&#39;t enlighten you. It illuminates the path. \u{1F449}\u{1F3FF} It points. \u{1F319} For all of those who feel disappointed, don&#39;t forget to shut off that light when you leave. \u{1F64F}\u{1F3FF} Namaste.

With Alpha and Beta waves, we act as Ego and Personality and we make the dream work. Great job, everyone! ",-1),Fn=u("<h1>Brainwave States</h1><p>There is a strong desire for transpersonal mystical States to provide scientific backing. One measure which is evident and easily comprehensible is EEG (electroencephalography). We can explore Branwave ranges and how they correspond to Major Ordinary States of consciousness, and also how those might correspond to an overlapping comparitive religious progression of milestones along the path of Waking Up, or transcendental mystical States as outlined in many traditional and alternative schools. </p><h3>BETA</h3><p>During the day when we take care of responsibilities, we use the awake, alert, responsive, productive Beta range. These brainwaves consume high energy, and can lead to stress, depletion, and poor health. We require rest! Or else we&#39;ll start talking about Gamma waves. </p><h3>ALPHA</h3><p>When we are in a more mellow or playful state of mind, we show more Alpha range. Deeper in this range, we reach the edge of sleep (hypnagogic state). Alpha is absorptive, synthesizing, and creative. Sometimes, to solve a problem, you just need to take a break. </p><h3>THETA</h3><p>Early meditation trials showed meditators entering Alpha brain states, but it was discovered that more advanced meditators get into Theta ranges. These are brainwaves that dominate the dream state and show up more heavily in children. The Theta state is indicative of access to Subtle states of waking up. However, for most of us, we only enter this state while dreaming. Some of us have no dream recall, most of us have scant dream recall, some of us lucid dream every night and approach Theta states each night with the same awareness and recall that we have throughout the day. These features tend to coarise. This is the Level of Identity as Psyche. It&#39;s the ultimate character of the relationshp between everything Ego does and doesn&#39;t know. Sweetest dreams and worst nightmares, treasures and dragons. Most people do not ordinarily enter Theta states consciously. Those who do can be called spiritual, and usual will identify as such. They may express Personality and Ego coordinations as soulful, gifted, uneven, perhaps eccentric, healthy inner child and intuitive creative vision. In these individuals, neglect of Personality and Ego (Shadow) are also common. </p><h3>DELTA</h3><p>The baseline hum of sentient living being. We experience a small amount of Delta (all by itself) when we are in deep dreamless sleep. Totally unconscious. The most advanced meditators in particular traditions (and also Ken Wilber) can display the ability to consciously access pure Delta States while still awake and aware. This appears to be the physical basis of what is commonly called spiritual enlightenment, nondual union, or transcendence. To experience Consciousness itself, without any forms or content or anything, is to see the truest and deepest version of yourself, and also the world, as One. You and every other living being are identical at this level, thus the actual nature of yourself is that you are the Universe. This core exists before anything, always, no matter what happens to a person, or everyone, no matter what happens in the story, this thing is simply here, watching. Those who experience constant consciousness through waking, dreaming, and deep sleep, every day, realize every Level, awake or at least present, all the time. This Nondual being is considered full enlightenment, or the &quot;fourth state&quot;, turiyatita. To describe this sort of thing in plain language completely fails to convey States that take decades for very dedicated experts with help to access if they are lucky. Words do not impart what it is to vibe with the entire cosmos and perceive the oneness of all existence, but what we hope to convey is that this is not mere mystical speculation. It has been observed and reported all throughout the world, throughout history. It may be interpreted countless ways, but this is real. </p>",10),Mn=u("<h1>Self Affinity</h1><p>As a transcendental mystic accesses higher States and State realms, it is common to hear descriptions of changes to the sense of self and identity. These changing State identities are here standardized into common, non-religious wording. They follow intuitively with the Brainwaves and transcendental State realms. </p><h3>PERSONALITY</h3><p>Identity with Personality is typical of Children and those up to Amber Meme. The personality is the character that you are playing in the present moment. Children have no self-monitoring, so they are pure personality. Much of their work is to gain self-awareness in order to understand and control their impulsivity. As adults, we use personalities in the roles that we play to fulfill our responsibilities. If overused, a person can start to feel self-less or ungrounded. Being pure personality as an adult is not well tolerated, generally considered regressed development or personality disorder. </p><h3>EGO</h3><p>Ego or I is a self-aware, reasonable agent. It understands its motives, it loves and hates and respects and tolerates, it governs the use of personalities, and it is ever focused on the way that it is perceived, appreciated, and responded to by others. Ego is neither good nor bad. Ironically, Ego is the judge of it. Ego is the controller of Personality. Our concept of adulthood generally describes prevalent, healthy ego. </p><h3>PSYCHE</h3><p>Disruptions in the psyche lead to mental illness, and so psychologists such as Freud and Jung attempted to map and comprehend its intricate depths. As you begin to gain awareness of how the Psyche functions, you can see that it is the source of concepts and feelings and the stories of your life. It is your style, your dreams, your soul. A person who begins to identify as Psyche, or is Psyche-aware, having Psychic States of consciousness, has fairly direct consciousness of their own process of constructing reality. Psychosis is the Psyche coming squirting out into the Ego space. It is senior to Ego. It contains Ego. So really, the Psyche is the self. The self includes more of the subconscious and the unconscious, and an awakened holistic view of the present moment.</p><h3>CONSCIOUSNESS</h3><p>There is one thing that is always here, whether we are waking, dreaming, or sleeping. That is consciousness. How do you know to wake up when someone kicks you? Something is awake, listening, and that&#39;s actually you. A witness to this everything. Witnessing the simple nondual feeling of being. Common to all sentient creatures, ever birthing and evolving forms. I Am, you are, and we have always been the creator of the Universe. It is being us, you, and I. We are the self-aware physical matter of Big Bang, the singing and dancing planet Earth, the history of Mind. If you could spend eternity in utter infinite formless nothingness, You would come to be and live and evolve and think and develop and Wake Up this. The Simple Feeling of Being is common to all moments, even unconscious. This is the deepest core of yourself and everything, your true identity. </p><h3>WAKING UP</h3><p> We cannot access these higher affinities or coordinations of the mind as long as we continue to construct the lower. We are conscious of a person, constructed into a person, viewing through a person, through other people. We have learned and coordinated through training to never access these States of utter freedom and bliss, creative brilliance, weeping joy, and other-worldly visions. Society continues to reinforce this. </p><h3>RATIONAL MYSTICISM</h3><p> Integral suggests this mono-mythic, universal donor theory of spiritual and transcendal State affinities and recommends meditation for the practice of Waking Up. State practices are available to all people, not just dead or religious people. These classically spiritual states of consciousness will become more commonplace as spirit unfolds, and will produce new stages of human development. Religion and romantic idealism view spirituality as a thing of the past that we have lost through corrupting development. Integral sees the past for what it was, barbaric, and enlightenment as a future evolutionary potential. Perhaps the backbone of progress. Looking back at history, it seems these very spiritual States were are implicated in the major evolution of culture, religion, history, intellect, and the self. </p>",14),$n=u("<h1>Spiritual States</h1><p>In this model, we are specifically talking about a generalized progression of State-stages, that is, stages of States, classically achieved through spiritual practice, typically meditation. Each of these States can be thought of as a Body, or Realm, as they entirely occupy your sensory experience and awareness while you are practicing successfully. Transcendental States can be experienced by anyone at any time, but to acquire them as Traits, or to be able to access the State at will at any time, requires a very intense effort to achieve. Each is experienced as a sort of reversal to the rules and the nature of reality. Each is often described as an epiphany, a communion with a higher identity or being, often intense, harsh, terrifying, disruptive, but nevertheless resulting in the person feeling as though they have awoken from a dream into a greater reality, that they are able to face everything they were never able to face before, that this experience was intensely life changing and impactful. </p><h3>GROSS</h3><p> This is our typical awareness. Our body. The material environment. Our personal concerns and worries, our stories, our people of interest. Our work. Our activities. Our stories. All the stories that everybody has. This is the gross realm, or State. </p><h3>PSYCHIC</h3><p> Not to be confused with paranormal abilities, it means psyche-aware. At this point, a person may maintain bodily thought and awareness, but a sort of daydreaming causes them to identify more with consciousness and their total holistic and ideological environment. If Psychic States are practiced regularly, a person becomes considerably more lucid, they may display forms of genius and high vulnerability. Psychic States, as the gateway to deeper practices, can be shocking, startling, and terrifying. They can lead to re-traumatization experiences, bizarre bodily phenomena, and general spooky stuff. </p><h3>SUBTLE</h3><p> The Subtle is an entire realm of pure mind. One way to hypothetically describe this state is that it is like dreaming while fully awake. Both parts are on at once. It takes a long time to enter, discover, and maintain these States. This is deep into the practice. A person who spends a lot of time in Subtle States is psyche-aware. They are self-aware of how their reality is constructed by stories and memes, or archetypes. </p><h3>CAUSAL</h3><p> This is the most-Subtle, or Causal, body or State realm. A person in this State will show practically no Beta or Alpha brainwaves, and they will describe dropping out of body and mind and becoming the pure essence of reality itself. This is the typical form of spiritual enlightenment, ultimate oneness, gnosis, or godhead. The self truly sees, once and for all, that it is nothing else besides the self, looking at the self. The Witness. No matter what happens, this is here, everywhere, forever. I am this. Infinite. Empty. Everything and everybody you know, every story, this whole dang thing is You. You crawled out of the ocean, you set this whole thing up. Its very funny. It is definintely not words, though, and it is definintely not knowledge. Talking about it is only an attempt to point out, or translate, one State from within another. </p><h3>NONDUAL</h3><p> It&#39;s always a little funny for a middling student of meditation to attempt to describe the ultimate culmination and fulfillment of the practice. But this is what Integral is all about. It is to shed some basic light, and lend some basic categories, to this whole thing that is the ultimate freedom, the ultimate bliss and surrender, the ultimate meaning of life, the universe, and everything. I will attempt to spoil the ending for both of us, with the understanding that I&#39;m not entirely sure that I stayed awake through the second half of the picture. The Causal State reveals the ultimate essence of the self and reality, a sort of singularity. The Nondual State is then integrating Causal into Waking, bringing that State into the world, as the world, as the most active agent and the most passive, emotionally-invested observer. This is a fully awake and enlightened person, if they stay that way, all the time. Constant consciousness through waking, dreaming, and deep sleep, and the ability to silence the entire brain at will. Exceedingly rare, also everpresent and always already realized. \u{1FAE5} </p>",12),Rn={class:"home-changer home-changer-int"},jn=["onClick"],Pn=e("h1",null,null,-1),Bn={class:"btn-group"},Un=["onClick"],Dn={key:0,class:"types-info"},On=u('<h1>Types</h1><img alt="Types elemental tarot Mini-Model" class="square-banner" src="'+Y+'"><p>If Levels are thought of as <b>Vertical</b> stages of Growing Up, then Types should account for the things about a person that never change, the <b>Horizontal</b> aspects. The prime differences between people at the same Level. What aspects of human expression never change? </p><p> Integral recommends Type-awareness and familiarity, but there is no system to recommend wholly on Integral merits. Extant typologies are pre-Integral, so their Types mostly correlate with unseen Levels and Quadrants more than anything else. Ironically, gender defaults as one of the more useful and robust typologies, as it is somewhat predictive, and mostly permanent. \u2640\uFE0F\u2642\uFE0F </p><p class="pedantic">Click below for overviews of popular and relevant Type systems. </p><h3>Typology Flaws</h3><p> Type systems either deliberately ignore or entirely fail to account for Levels, Lines, States, and Quadrants. Integral Types should hopefully remain constant throughout development, State practice, and even better if it shows up in all four Quadrants. Otherwise, account for these flaws theoretically. If a typology contains no measure of neuroticism, Integral would recommend passing the sample through the official diagnostic criteria. Otherwise, mental health disorders would completely throw off any attempt to find healthy human Types. Mental health, just like maturity and physical health, has enormous impact on a person&#39;s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. </p><h3>Types Are Green Meme</h3><p> In other words, the fundamental law of typology, that Types must be equally valuable, examined in isolation, and caused by nothing (even if that isn&#39;t true), causes us to desire an Integral Type system, or to dismiss Types from Integral Theory. Types are not rejected, but included as one of Five Modules that describe the nature of reality. Integral may seem reductive towards first tier typologies, just as First Tier perspectives are reductive towards Integral. </p><h3>Green World \u{1F7E9}</h3><p> Academic and philosophical communities are very opposed to notions of growth heirarchy, as well as &quot;labeling&quot; people or their behavior. Green dismisses Integral as reductionistic, offensive, stereotyping, and oppressive. If you have to be able to tell the difference between people, as in every pursuit, and if you want to understand why you are the way you are, what sort of lifestyle and occupation would be appropriate for you, you are left with Types. Ordinary people turn to extraordinary pseudo-scientific, conceptually and methodologically bankrupt systems, such as astrology, a typology sporting zero predictive power or pragmatic use for stated purposes. </p><h3>Primordial Types</h3><p> Anything that has features has Types. It might split into twos, or threes, or seven, or it might be complicated and subjective how to divide it up. Here you may explore sacred geometry, numerology, and alchemy, that propose various Typologies of the kosmos. The Integral perspective acknowledges the astounding conceptual overlap between Type systems, and for our own system, we recommend Jungian Types (not archetypes but cognitive functions), but also that they all hone in on the same traits: extraversion, collectivism, abstraction, coherence. </p><h3>Types and Integral</h3><p>Levels are perhaps more descriptive of people overall than any Type system. With vertical Levels, consciousness moves through the same sequence, in one direction, slowly and unevenly, without skipping, over time. Horizontal means that Type should not show a developmental sequence or pattern. In general, Levels can be thought to change by traversing Types. Developmental sequences in Types are commonplace, but these often become impractical or pseudo-scientific. Quadrant preference creates an implied Typology. Line preferences imply Types. And of course, States are a galaxy of Types that constantly change. </p><h3>Illness Types</h3><p> Clinical psychology (as opposed to positive) identifies people by assessing their symptoms and comparing them against diagnostic criteria. This is an extremely advanced and highly scientific human Type system, intended to treat people with mental health problems. The methodology is not coming from a sophisticated understanding of consciousness, the mind, the brain, and behavior. It is coming from a practical scientific approach of assembling complaints (symptoms) into categories, and then testing treatments to see if there is a statistical reduction of complaints. If there is a statistical reduction of complaints, and side effects are decidedly worth it, it then becomes medicine for consciousness, the mind, the brain, and behavior, regardless of what&#39;s actually happening. If you complain, and want help, you describe symptoms and will be diagnosed according to clinical Typing. It&#39;s as likely to get you to stop complaining about symptoms as it claims to be. </p><h3>Integral Medicine</h3><p>People start diagnosing themselves with various illnesses because the DSM criteria is the only Type system that is considered serious. And it is influenced by politics, big pharma, medical lobbying, and chemical dependency. Integral includes Types of clinical pathology, suggests new mental health concepts, and offers tools to help conceptualize the various conditions. </p>',19),Qn=[On],Gn={key:1},Nn=u('<h3>Sexing Nature</h3><p> Male and female is a duality which appears to exist at every Level of reality, including sex, gender, and sexual orientation, all of which occur at particular Levels. At the material Level, we have form and emptiness, matter and space, something and nothing. As life forms, we have some sort of fundamental sexual essence, which is expressed by DNA as genitals and reproductive features, and by male and female behaviors. These range from animal to animal, but a sperm is a little pin that penetrates into the egg, just as the penis penetrates into the vagina, the female is more the home creature, while the male is more the one who goes out. Not always. The female cares for the young, the male provides for them. Not always. </p><h3>Agency and Communion</h3><p> The &quot;spiraling&quot; of Spiral Dynamics, or the back and forth tendency of each Level, is a movement between gendered concepts of agency \u2642\uFE0F and communion \u2640\uFE0F. Development implicates an integration of various Levels of masculine and feminine projection, or animus and anima (quite literally at Level 9). This does not imply transgenderism or androgyny, particularly. Rather, that genitals come from the biological Life Level of Infrared instinct, gender forms atop sex through Magenta \u2640\uFE0F and Red \u2642\uFE0F Personality concepts, sexual relationships and family form atop gender and relate to Amber \u2640\uFE0F and Orange \u2642\uFE0F needs and interests. Gender and sexual experimentation and questioning are often Green \u2640\uFE0F. Cognitive and character ambidextrousness is Second Tier. </p><h3>\u262F\uFE0F Taoism \u262F\uFE0F</h3><p> Taoism is a religion of simple, elegant transcendent nonduality. Tao translates in various ways, but often, the Way. As in, the Way of things. A balance of opposing dualistic principles (Yin and Yang) is the Way to enlightenment. But also, a Map shows the Way. A Map like AQALALATAS? Yeah, a map of the nature of reality. </p><p> What is so special about this symbol of quaternity (and Quadrants, mandala, cross, and swastika), is that it applies to every Level. As we said, the Levels all have their own sense of &quot;sex,&quot; &quot;gender,&quot; and &quot;orientation,&quot; or simply duality in successive Levels. </p><p> A circle is reality. In the circle of reality, a wave cuts through the middle. This wave divides reality in half, a light half, filled in with white form, and an identical black half is reflected in the symmetrical empty space. The white section is male yang, opposed to female yin. A single dot, or eye, of each color, penetrates the center of each wave, suggesting they enfold and reflect one another, perhaps immanent or interpenetrating, or simply, they two are One. The overall wavelike shape suggests spinning, mixing, or a cycle. </p><h3>Tao Quadrants</h3><p> White is interior, the light of consciousness, experience. Everything the whole world is conscious of is white, LL. Everything I&#39;m conscious of is the tiny white dot, UL. The ultimate nature of existence is unkown, the black wave, LR. The ultimate nature of me is unkown, my black dot, UR. The waves reflect one another, as reality appears to be whatever we understand it to be. What we understand it to be must reflect (increasingly) what it actually is. As society brings light to nature, my little light goes into my work. </p><h3>I Made This All Up \u{1F923}</h3><p> I experience myself (white dot) as separate from culture (white wave) and environment (black dot), but directly experience myself as white dot, and my abstract conception of reality (black wave). I can gain known information from the big white, by asking people, reading books, Google search. I can&#39;t see. It&#39;s dark around me. I&#39;m alone. The black is exterior, what we are conscious of, what we experience. </p><p> And I am aware that the collective (white wave LL) can see my body and environment (black eye UR) directly, and I see that I punch a hole in their conformity from my own perspective by experiencing myself. None of them are like me. I&#39;m only this one. I&#39;m a tiny part of their world, a tiny informatino source (White Wave LL), and a tiny part of reality (Black Wave LR). And yet I can view reality as a whole, and the information and experience that I have (Tao) is all of reality from anyone&#39;s perspective. </p><table class="work-schedules"><tr><th>Quadrant</th><td>UL &quot;I&quot;</td><td>UR &quot;It&quot;</td><td>LL &quot;We&quot;</td><td>LR &quot;Its&quot;</td></tr><tr><th>Tao</th><td>White Eye</td><td>Black Eye</td><td>White Wave</td><td>Black Wave</td></tr><tr><th>Description</th><td>My Experience</td><td>My Environment</td><td>Humanity</td><td>The Universe</td></tr><tr><th>Jung Function</th><td>Intuition</td><td>Sensing</td><td>Feeling</td><td>Thinking</td></tr></table>',14),Yn=[Nn],Hn={key:2},Jn=u('<h2>Your Brain does Four Things</h2><p> Psychologist Carl Jung provided for us two Typologies which are often referenced today. One of them (&quot;archetypes&quot; section) presents a Typology based on self concept role playing archetypal built-in story character myths. In any moment, our personality is invoking, or play-acting some collection of story characters. The Typology we will explore here is the notion of four primary cognitive functions, and is the basis of Myers-Briggs, roughly equivalent. </p><p>The four things your brain can do are thinking, feeling, sensing, and intuiting. This theory restates Quadrants and Tao (&quot;gender&quot; section), but in terms of what the Mind is doing in these four perspectives. </p><p><b>Intuiting</b> is looking inward, to the mystery, pattern recognizing, scanning, introspecting, creativity, thrill-seeking, asserting, facing things. It is the UL perspective, white eye of Tao. </p><p><b>Sensing</b> is looking outward, at the environment, deductive, planning, organizing, tracking. It is the UR perspective, black eye of Tao. </p><p><b>Thinking</b> is looking outward, to the conceptual abstract, inductive, strategizing, ordering, sense-making. It is the LR perspective, black wave of Tao. </p><p><b>Feeling</b> is looking inward, at relationships and affiliation, trust, morality, influence, charisma, cooperation. It is the LL perspective, white wave of Tao. </p><h3>How They Work</h3><p>The functions are considered equally valid and valuable ways to comprehend reality, and may suggest attachment and safety dynamics in early development, or simply native traits. Your personality is shaped by preference between these four functions, just as we may express left or right handed, or male or female gender. </p><h3>Introversion and Extraversion</h3><p> The introvert feels secure in their own ideas and notions, their own company, their own self-regulation, prefering more individualistic activities in social life. The extravert feels secure in the collective knowledge and wisdom and the give and take of energy through communication, working through community, reciprocity, and collaboration. </p><h3>Dominant Cognitive Function</h3><p> This introversion or extraversion tendency applies to the primary or dominant function (sensing, intuiting, feeling, or thinking). This is what your brain does best, what you prefer and feel secure doing. This is balanced out with the other functions, or you would be dysfunctional overall. </p><h3>Secondary Function</h3><p> The secondary cognitive function provides the balance of an inverse to the extraversion or introversion of the dominant. It will also cross the up-down, or individual/collective axis of the Quadrants, between the Judging functions of Thinking and Feeling, versus the Perceiving functions of Sensing and Intuiting. </p><p>ESxP: If your dominant function is extraverted sensing (Se), your secondary function is introverted feeling (Fi) or thinking (Ti). </p><p>IxTP: If your dominant function is introverted thinking (Ti), your secondary function is extraverted sensing (Se) or intuiting (Ie). </p><p>In whatever case, the two functions left out are your tertiary and inferior functions. Your brain prefers the dominant function and its compensatory secondary, supplemented with the tertiary and its compliment. The remaining eight combinations are possibilities atypical of your personality. These sixteen possibilities are also Quadrants within Quadrants, or aspects of Tao in relation to one another. </p><h3>Are Types Integral?</h3><p> One point we&#39;re trying to nail down here, all these Typologies seem to largely point out the same traits, suggesting that they are either copying one another, or pointing to universal truths. Further, as illustrated, these concepts are nearly covered by Quadrants, or an expanded notion of Quadrants. </p><table class="work-schedules"><tr><th>Quadrants</th><th class="border-blue">UL</th><th class="border-pink">UR</th><th class="border-blue">LL</th><th class="border-pink">LR</th></tr><tr><th>Tao Symbol</th><td class="border-blue">White Eye</td><td class="border-pink">Black Eye</td><td class="border-blue">White Wave</td><td class="border-pink">Black Wave</td></tr><tr><th>Functions</th><td>Intuiting</td><td>Sensing</td><td>Feeling</td><td>Thinking</td></tr><tr><th>Elements</th><td class="border-blue">Fire</td><td class="border-pink">Earth</td><td class="border-pink">Water</td><td class="border-blue">Air</td></tr><tr><th>Tarot Cards</th><td class="border-blue">Wands</td><td class="border-pink">Pentacles</td><td class="border-pink">Cups</td><td class="border-blue">Swords</td></tr><tr><th>Card-ass Cards</th><td class="border-black">Clubs</td><td class="border-red">Diamonds</td><td class="border-red">Hearts</td><td class="border-black">Spades</td></tr><tr><th>Sorting Hat</th><td>Gryffindor</td><td>Slytherin</td><td>Hufflepuff</td><td>Ravenclaw</td></tr></table><p class="pedantic">Please correct me if I&#39;m certainly wrong about these mythological associations. There will always be debate because these are imaginary and there are multiple correct solutions. </p><p>We must conclude for now that many typologies are redundant and correlated with Integral Theory, and too flawed to adopt as primary Integral vocabulary. However, like Lines, Types are a lens, or way of slicing reality and consciousness up to examine them and make them more comprehensible. If Lines take the whole of reality and tear it into vertical strips of various length, Types can then organize those according to patterns which collectively emerge in the lengths of slices. It is a powerful and unique mechanic in theory. In the case of diagnosis, Types can devise thresholds and parameters for health and sickness. We could cover various relevant popular theories like Adult Attachment Styles, Love Language, and things like that. Among these, the Integral mind again seeks to find how they relate to one another, and which covers and includes the most reality in the least space. </p><h3>Integral Typology</h3><p> Nevertheless, it is hard to believe that the uniqueness of a self, any old person, that stays with them their whole life, can not be more easily categorized in terms of commonality and difference with large percentages of the population in terms of the most salient factors, and one would assume this would lead to enormous mechanical insights into the nature of Mind and Personality. For now, Integral Typology consists of using these various unrelated systems and being aware of them, while also drawing attention to a critical appreciation of the problem. </p>',25),Vn=[Jn],Kn={key:3,class:"types-model"},Xn=e("h2",null,"Verdict:",-1),Zn={class:"btn-group"},eo=["onClick"],to=e("h2",null,"Stages:",-1),ao={key:"stg.title"},io=u('<h1>Lines</h1><p class="pedantic">Buttons along the bottom outline some prominent Line systems. </p><p>Particular aspects of people develop somewhat independently.<br> These can be called developmental Lines, multiple intelligences, or Streams. Streams never caught on, but it emphasizes that these all flow together as the overall self or Mind, and what you consider to be the subdivisions of that flow are arbitrary to the given context or application. It&#39;s all water running downhill. </p><h3>The Nature of Intelligence</h3><p> IQ is only an attempt to proxy overall cognitive aptitude, as is Altitudes. We commonly understand intelligence and ability to refer to several inter-related aspects of a person. Lines are different types of intelligence, maturity, complexity, sensitivity, awareness, or development. </p><h3>Anything that Develops is a Line</h3><p> We often use Emotional Intelligence Quotient, EQ, alongside IQ. This allows us to view cognitive development in terms of two factors, or Lines, rather than just one. Levels can be represented as one Line, two Lines, or any number of Lines, and the granularity of each scope yields application-specific insights. Psychologist <b>Howard Gardner</b> popularized the concept of <b>Multiple Intelligences,</b> and proposed <b>eight of them:</b></p><div style="list-style-type:none;"><b> Visual-spatial<br> Linguistic-verbal<br> Logical-mathematical<br> Body-kinesthetic<br> Musical<br> Interpersonal<br> Intrapersonal<br> Naturalistic</b></div><h3>Flavors of Mind</h3><p> Theoretically, we could consider Lines an inexaustible ocean of highly specific memetic talents (like the Badges you get in Cub Scouts), and that could yield a very interesting analysis. The opposite of that would be something like IQ or Altitudes, which attempt to generalize mental ability into a single parameter. Specific tests are common, of course, and every school child that gets an A, every karate student that gets a belt, can consider that a Line development. In terms of comprehending reality and consciousness, particular Lines and milestones are more fundamental, holistic, or essential than others. This calls for refinement of orthodox approaches, which has not been accomplished because Integral Theory is not well known. </p><h3>Smarty Pants \u{1F456}</h3><p> You may call someone &quot;smart&quot; because they are socially adept, technically proficient, intellectually profound, considerate, inventive, witty, detail-oriented, on top of practical matters, ahead of the game, or because their pants look nice. On the other hand, people who clearly display outstanding cognitive intelligence may potentially be socially inept, absent-minded, irresponsible, morally despicable, or wear cargo shorts unironically. </p><h3>Lines are Not Created Equal</h3><p> The ability to speak clearly is more essential than the ability to tie a cherry stem inside your mouth with your tongue. Being in excellent overall physical health, body awareness, sensitivity, and control, are more essential to your humanity than specifically how well you tap dance. At the same time, in order to get to the highest Levels of tap, you would certainly require both the specific methods of the tap practice, as well as development of more general kinesthetic, musical, and physical bodily Lines. </p><h3>We Are Islands \u{1F3DD}\uFE0F</h3><p> While it may feel that we have strayed from the topic of comprehending reality into personality profiling, the Integral theorist must take care to observe the philosophical gravity of this concept - that a practice of developing particular abilities (practically everything a person deliberately does) results in different conceptions of reality. No matter what overall Level I believe I&#39;m expressing, I can only comprehend this with my dominant Lines, and I probably will not comprehend advanced expressions of other Lines, communicated by others. </p><h3>How Many Lines Are There?</h3><p> Ken Wilber names anywhere from a handful to ten of these more central or pertinent Lines, and over a hundred that have been studied overall. The grain level (how specific or general) of the Line system you use should reflect the task. An academic or scientist needs to clearly define their Line and its particular context in human development. We philosophical generalists do not require expertise in the work of numerous developmental psychologists, but the notion of independent developmental Lines recapitulating Level patterns expressed by social holons is one of Integral Theory&#39;s five central mechanics. </p><h3>Levels of Lines</h3><p>Altitudes are a system of archetypal meta-meme Levels which all Lines develop through. To illustrate this, we turn to the work of many of the major names in developmental psychology, and we can see in the Integral Psychograph image that all of these independent stage theories of various Lines of development have an unmistakable overlap. </p><img alt="Integral Psychograph" class="stu-banner" src="'+H+'"><p>(This image originally from Integral Life resources.)</p><p>The Altitudes system characterizes these core patterns and enables developmentalists (which is everyone who learns or teaches) to compare across Lines and see the overlap and appreciate the true urgency of the fact that self, culture, and nature are all generated by these underlying holonic stacks of knowing, feeling, and being. </p><h3>Home Cookin \u{1F373}</h3><p> For the utmost simplicity and comprehension, we encourage a <b>3-Line Mini-Model: Think -&gt; Feel -&gt; Do. Think</b> is a proxy for various cognitive and conceptual Lines, <b>Feel</b> reflects values, self sense, affect, and affinity Lines, and <b>Do</b> generalizes Lines that measure behavior, lifestyle, and social acumen. </p><img alt="Lines Mini-Model Think Feel Do" class="square-banner" src="'+B+'"><p>We especially like this model for the practice of trying to judge what overall Level someone mostly expresses. We have argued that it starts with comprehending the Level, perhaps talking about it and Thinking it, which then leads to seeing the Level in your environment, world, culture, and interactions, stirring you to Feel. Then it becomes a value, and you identify with the Level. Finally, that motivates a person to actually Do the Level, which is their actual behavior, baseline, and social intercourse. We believe a person first thinks, then feels, then does. That may be a Type preference, and perhaps somebody very extroverted may find themself doing things without comprehending what their motive is, and this may lead to a feeling of affinity with the group and the situation, before finally, a conceptual understanding is reached. \u{1F937}\u{1F3FF}\u200D\u2640\uFE0F </p><h3>Uneven Development</h3><p> It is possible to be at advanced Levels in some Lines, and underdeveloped in others, allowing people to specialize in certain Lines. An athlete is clearly developing <em>something</em> about their person or intelligence, as is a salesman, a clergywoman, a navy seal, a chessmaster, or musical artist. In all of these cases, it is not particularly IQ that is developed. </p><h3>Hero Worship</h3><p> It is often safe to assume as a rule of thumb that a person&#39;s strongest talent indicates their highest-Level Line, and doesn&#39;t indicate that they are equally advanced at everything. Thus, take care in selecting teachers and role models. A movie star got there by being great at acting. A cult guru might be charismatic and persuasive above all. A comedian is quite funny. A politician is diplomatic. There is no reason to assume any of these people are safe to be around, based on their primary specialization in life. </p><h3>Shadow of Excellence</h3><p>The hallowing reminder of Lines is that a role model or hero is probably advanced in some particular Line you value, such as charisma, abilities, genius intellect, or spirituality. The Shadow side of that hero figure which is being compensated for may potentially be underdeveloped moral values, regressed psychosexual development, or pathology concerning interpersonal power and control. Some of them are monsters. Most heroes turn out to be utterly normal, flawed, unimpressive people <em>other than</em> the thing they do extremely well. People can also have a lot of major Lines at very high Levels, too. This is the explicit goal of Level 7 integral developer. </p><h3>\u2694\uFE0F Integral Dungeons &amp; Dragons \u{1F6E1}\uFE0F </h3><p>Consider an RPG stat sheet. Your individual stats are your Lines, and while you yourself Level up as a whole character (Altitudes) your individual attribute stats will also develop <em>somewhat</em> independently. A min-maxed character is advanced in some Lines, with other Lines at low stages. This allows low-level characters to be OP in specialized circumstances. \u{1F60B} </p><img alt="video game character stats" class="invert stu-banner" src="'+J+'"><h3>Integral Lines</h3><p>While Lines are a methodologically superb way of analyzing specific strengths of a human being, including moral, cognitive, care and concern, self sense, and worldview, Integral does not currently recognize a satisfactory standard set of Lines. Typically, these researchers set out to measure their Line in isolation, without regard for consistency within a parent structure. The Integral Psychograph chart is not intended to be comprehensive, exhaustive, or anything more than an essay. It is simply to set major important Line research side by side and see the overlap as Altitude Levels. </p><p> It is not entirely necessary to study developmental psychology. You can get away with a Mini-Model, Spiral Dynamics, or any major Line, as long as you bear in mind that various aspects of individuals show up at different Altitudes, and nobody yet has made a great case for an exhaustive, minimal, and empirically verified set of developmental Lines. </p>',39),oo=E({__name:"Integral",setup(y){document.title="Integral Theory Map";const h=k("base");$(h,()=>{window.scrollTo(0,0)});const i=["Map","Quadrants","Levels","Lines","Types","States"],m=k("Map"),a=b=>{m.value=b,window.scrollTo(0,0)},n=k({number:"",color:"",desc:"",values:"",nickname:"",emergence:"",relate:""}),f=k({line:"",name:"",description:"",author:"",stages:{},notes:""}),U=()=>{f.value={line:"",name:"",description:"",author:"",stages:{},notes:""}},L=k(""),T=k(!1),D=()=>{T.value=!T.value},g=b=>{if(b==="base")n.value={number:"",color:"",desc:"",values:"",nickname:"",emergence:"",relate:""},T.value=!0;else{let s=j.filter(l=>l.color==b).pop();s!==void 0&&(n.value=s,T.value=!0)}},O=b=>{let s=P.filter(l=>l.name==b).pop();s!==void 0&&(f.value=s)};$(f,()=>{window.scrollTo(0,0)});const _=b=>{L.value=b,T.value=!0};return(b,s)=>(o(),r("div",vn,[T.value?(o(),r("div",{class:"info-panel",onClick:D,key:"apple"},[m.value=="Levels"?(o(),r(c,{key:0},[e("div",bn,[(o(!0),r(c,null,x(I(j),({color:l,number:v})=>(o(),r("button",{onClick:R(z=>g(l),["stop"])},p(v),9,wn))),256))]),n.value.color?(o(),r(c,{key:1},[e("h1",null,[q("Level "+p(n.value.number)+" "+p(n.value.color.toUpperCase())+" ",1),e("span",Tn,p(n.value.desc),1)]),e("h3",null,[q("Nickname: "),e("span",In,p(n.value.nickname),1)]),Ln,e("p",null,p(n.value.values),1),_n,e("p",null,p(n.value.emergence),1),zn,e("p",null,p(n.value.relate),1)],64)):(o(),r(c,{key:0},[xn,kn],64))],64)):m.value=="States"?(o(),r(c,{key:1},[e("div",Cn,[(o(),r(c,null,x(["ordinary","brainwaves","selves","spiritual"],l=>e("button",{onClick:R(v=>L.value=l,["stop"])},p(l),9,An)),64))]),L.value==="ordinary"?(o(),r(c,{key:0},[Sn,qn,En,Wn],64)):L.value==="brainwaves"?(o(),r(c,{key:1},[Fn],64)):L.value==="selves"?(o(),r(c,{key:2},[Mn],64)):(o(),r(c,{key:3},[$n],64))],64)):S("",!0)])):S("",!0),e("div",Rn,[(o(),r(c,null,x(i,l=>e("a",{onClick:v=>a(l),key:l},p(l),9,jn)),64))]),Pn,m.value=="Map"?(o(),C(zi,{key:1})):m.value=="Quadrants"?(o(),C(Xe,{key:2})):m.value=="Levels"?(o(),C(wi,{key:3,onInfrared:s[0]||(s[0]=l=>g("infrared")),onMagenta:s[1]||(s[1]=l=>g("magenta")),onRed:s[2]||(s[2]=l=>g("red")),onAmber:s[3]||(s[3]=l=>g("amber")),onOrange:s[4]||(s[4]=l=>g("orange")),onGreen:s[5]||(s[5]=l=>g("green")),onTeal:s[6]||(s[6]=l=>g("teal")),onTurquoise:s[7]||(s[7]=l=>g("turquoise")),onIndigo:s[8]||(s[8]=l=>g("indigo")),onViolet:s[9]||(s[9]=l=>g("violet")),onUltraviolet:s[10]||(s[10]=l=>g("ultraviolet")),onClearlight:s[11]||(s[11]=l=>g("clearlight"))})):m.value=="Types"?(o(),r(c,{key:4},[e("div",Bn,[e("button",{onClick:s[12]||(s[12]=l=>h.value="base")},"unthinkme"),e("button",{onClick:s[13]||(s[13]=l=>h.value="gender")},"gender"),e("button",{onClick:s[14]||(s[14]=l=>h.value="jungian")},"jungian"),(o(!0),r(c,null,x(I(A),(l,v)=>(o(),r("button",{class:"darken",onClick:z=>h.value=v,key:v},p(v),9,Un))),128))]),h.value=="base"?(o(),r("div",Dn,Qn)):h.value=="gender"?(o(),r("div",Gn,Yn)):h.value=="jungian"?(o(),r("div",Hn,Vn)):(o(),r("div",Kn,[e("h2",null,"Type System: "+p(h.value[0].toUpperCase()+h.value.slice(1)),1),e("p",null,p(I(A)[h.value].description),1),(o(!0),r(c,null,x(I(A)[h.value].types,l=>(o(),r(c,null,[e("h3",null,p(l.type),1),e("p",null,p(l.desc),1)],64))),256)),Xn,e("p",null,p(I(A)[h.value].setbacks),1)]))],64)):m.value=="Lines"?(o(),r(c,{key:5},[e("div",Zn,[e("button",{onClick:U},"unThinkMe"),(o(!0),r(c,null,x(I(P),(l,v)=>(o(),r("button",{onClick:z=>O(l.name),key:v},p(l.line),9,eo))),128))]),f.value.line?(o(),r(c,{key:0},[e("h1",null,p(f.value.line),1),e("h2",null,p(f.value.name),1),e("h2",null,"Author: "+p(f.value.author),1),e("h3",null,p(f.value.description),1),to,(o(!0),r(c,null,x(f.value.stages,({title:l,desc:v},z)=>(o(),r("div",ao,[e("h4",null,p(z)+": "+p(l),1),e("p",null,p(v),1)]))),128)),e("h3",null,p(f.value.notes),1)],64)):(o(),r(c,{key:1},[io],64))],64)):m.value=="States"?(o(),C(gn,{key:6,onOrdinary:s[15]||(s[15]=l=>_("ordinary")),onBrainwaves:s[16]||(s[16]=l=>_("brainwaves")),onSelves:s[17]||(s[17]=l=>_("selves")),onSpiritual:s[18]||(s[18]=l=>_("spiritual"))})):S("",!0)]))}});export{oo as default};
