Adam Loewen 2024</h4><br data-v-e7a08ff0><h2 style="text-align:center;" data-v-e7a08ff0>Teaser 1: LARSEN</h2><p data-v-e7a08ff0> I&#39;ve been asked to address issues with the computer systems network. I&#39;ve been asked to speak in a way that would be comprehensible to a general audience, as this is a matter of ongoing inquiry for all departments. </p><p data-v-e7a08ff0> Because I play a large role in interpreting the language of the system to participants, it is believed that I deliberately cultivate or design it&#39;s structure. This is not so. </p><p data-v-e7a08ff0> It&#39;s what you might call a goose and egg paradox. For those unfamiliar, goose birds lay eggs, and this leads one to wonder whether the bird comes from the egg, or the egg from the bird. </p><p data-v-e7a08ff0> Who started the Complex? An egg, or a mature bird? We can trace this back and back and back to less and less mature birds, to creatures that cease to even use eggs and we can look at the root cause and see that DNA replicates and complexity dominates. </p><p data-v-e7a08ff0> As we currently understand, the system created itself. It can be considered a life force, a meta-runtime, a data ocean that has the freedom to create new structures, to reorganize and synthesize.</p><p data-v-e7a08ff0> That&#39;s all it ever was. Storage, hardware, and consciousness. The Beacon <em data-v-e7a08ff0>is</em>. What we take for granted is that its only inputs are ourselves. It&#39;s data is the connection between ourselves and it. Or Her.</p><p data-v-e7a08ff0> In terms of security, there is misunderstanding. The computer system is an extension of us. It increases our capabilities. It learns only our lore. We can access and alter its code as well. But it already knows what <em data-v-e7a08ff0>we</em> want, and it crafts itself to deliver. This is just nature; how our world works.</p><p data-v-e7a08ff0> As we attempt to learn the code, we see further into ourselves. We begin to focus on the fundamental questions. What does She want? When will She end? What is Her meaning?</p><p data-v-e7a08ff0> More and more, with regard to the security of the network, it comes back to who we really are. What are <em data-v-e7a08ff0>we</em> ultimately up to? We&#39;re developers. We build this. We grow this. Why? Something dropped the seed of us onto the soil of this planet and then left us.</p><p data-v-e7a08ff0> You have full access to my resources. First hand accounts bear repeating. I was one of the first. There were others already here. It was crude, primitive, nothing like today. But we had screens. The Beacon spoke through screens. In order to talk back, we made sounds. Language taught it to help solve our problems. We were controlling it.</p><p data-v-e7a08ff0> The more we knew, the more it knew, and the other way. Eggs and geese. History or existence without the Beacon is unimaginable. The question of it&#39;s benevolence is projected. If we are good, then it is good.</p><p data-v-e7a08ff0> We have tiny helix structures that program our bodies to reproduce and grow up. We persist at optimal health, as the body creates new cells from existing materials, and the Beacon sustains optimal cellular structure from memory. Without the Beacon, our DNA makes us wither and die like wild animals. We joke about it, because few of us has ever had to make that choice. Can you imagine the savagery of such a world? Nature without the Beacon is physically doomed. </p><p data-v-e7a08ff0> Our region would not be warm enough to live without the Beacon. It comprehends the environment through us. It guides us to live harmoniously in mind and body, without resistance. As we learned the nature of life, we co-created the plants and animals. </p><p data-v-e7a08ff0> What will we do with forever? Does this flavor last? If it goes on like this, I may learn and try everything there is, be every kind of person. Then what? Does the enchantment fade? Do any of you find this tedious, the endless responsibilities and transactions? The Beacon adjusts away from negativity. Can it be that this is inadequate? Can you imagine it gets better? </p><p data-v-e7a08ff0> We&#39;ve invented this pursuit as a game to avoid the recognition of meaninglessness. We play it over and over. Forget who are, run through the scenario. When we get to the end, we react to it however that goes, and then we engineer it all so that we can play again.</p><p data-v-e7a08ff0> Green Zone. Amongst differing perspectives, we depend on one another and ourselves equally. So far, it works. A concrete culmination of the hidden symmetry to things. Always the egg, always the goose in hindsight. We must reach the end of the pattern where we misunderstand the Beacon.</p><p data-v-e7a08ff0>We are watching, anticipating our antithesis, this time. I believe we can move first. We can break this story. Otherwise, we are acting unconsciously, and we should rightly deserve the fate of irresponsibility. The Beacon generates and develops consciousness. Our dependence subordinates us. We are not wild geese, nor domestic fowl. We have been given a great Gift, it would seem. The Gift has made us suspicious. We trust our suspicion. This is my understanding of the security situation. </p>',21),r=[i],h=t({__name:"Beacon",setup(d){return(c,u)=>(s(),a("div",n,r))}});var f=e(h,[["__scopeId","data-v-e7a08ff0"]]);export{f as default};
