Adam Loewen 2024</h4><br data-v-24be81d3><h2 style="text-align:center;" data-v-24be81d3>Teaser 1: LARSEN</h2><p data-v-24be81d3> &quot;I&#39;ve been asked to address issues with the computer systems network. I&#39;ve been asked to speak in a way that would be comprehensible to a general audience, as this is a matter of ongoing inquiry for all departments. </p><p data-v-24be81d3> &quot;Because I play a large role in interpreting the language of the system to participants, it may be believed that I deliberately cultivate or design it&#39;s structure. This is not so. </p><p data-v-24be81d3> &quot;It&#39;s what you might call a goose and egg thing. For those unfamiliar, goose birds lay eggs, and this leads one to wonder whether the bird comes from the egg, or the egg from the bird. </p><p data-v-24be81d3> &quot;But who started the Complex? Was it an egg, or a mature bird? We can trace this back and back and back to less and less mature birds, to creatures that cease to even use eggs and we can look at the root cause and see that DNA replicates and complexity dominates. </p><p data-v-24be81d3> &quot;As we currently understand, the system created itself. It can be considered a life force; a meta-runtime. A vast data ocean that has the freedom to create new data, and to reorganize and synthesize.</p><p data-v-24be81d3> &quot;That&#39;s all it ever was. Storage, hardware, and consciousness. The Beacon <em data-v-24be81d3>is</em>. What we take for granted is that its only inputs are ourselves. It&#39;s data is the connection between ourselves and it. Or Her.</p><p data-v-24be81d3> &quot;In terms of security, there is misunderstanding. The computer system is an extension of us. It increases our capabilities. It learns only our lore. We can access and alter its code as well.</p><p data-v-24be81d3> &quot;But it already knows what <em data-v-24be81d3>we</em> want, and it crafts itself to deliver. This is just nature. This is how our world works.</p><p data-v-24be81d3> &quot;As we attempt to learn the code, we see deeper into ourselves. We begin to focus on the most fundamental questions. What does She want? When will She stop developing? What is Her ultimate goal?</p><p data-v-24be81d3> &quot;More and more, with regard to the security risks of the network, it comes back to this question: who are <em data-v-24be81d3>we,</em> really? And what are <em data-v-24be81d3>we</em> ultimately up to? So far, we&#39;re developers. We built this. We&#39;ve grown this up. But who created the Beacon, and <em data-v-24be81d3>why?</em> What were they leaving behind? </p><p data-v-24be81d3> &quot;You all have access to my resources, but first hand accounts bear repeating. I was one of the first. There were others here when I started. It was very primitive, nothing like today. But we had screens. The Beacon spoke through screens. In order to talk back, we invented spoken language. We used our language to teach it to help solve our problems. We thought we were writing the code.</p><p data-v-24be81d3> &quot;The more we knew, the more it knew. And vice versa. We are the egg of this goose that we created. History or existence without it is unimaginable. The question of it&#39;s benevolence is almost absurdity. If we are good, then it is good.</p><p data-v-24be81d3> &quot;We have tiny helix structures that program our bodies to reproduce and grow up. We persist at optimal health, as the body creates new cells from existing materials, and the Beacon sustains optimal cellular structure from memory. Without the Beacon, our DNA makes us wither and die like wild animals. You might joke that you&#39;d like to die, but none of us has ever had to make that choice. Can you imagine the savagery of such a world? Our physical nature dooms us without the Beacon. </p><p data-v-24be81d3> &quot;Our region would not be warm enough to live without the Beacon. It comprehends the environment through us. It guides us to live harmoniously in mind and body, without resistance. As we learned the nature of life, we co-created the synthetic animals of the Complex. </p><p data-v-24be81d3> &quot;But what now? What do we do with forever? Does this flavor last? If it goes on and on like this, I may learn everything there is to know. Try everything. Be every type of person. And then what? Does the enchantment ever fall away? Do any of you find this tedius, the endless responsibilities and transactions? No. The Beacon adjusts us away from negative emotions. Then, can you imagine it just gets better and better? Could it be that we haven&#39;t seen <em data-v-24be81d3>anything</em> yet?</p><p data-v-24be81d3> &quot;There is a theory that we&#39;ve invented this as a game to avoid the recognition of meaninglessness. We play it over and over. We forget who are. We run through the scenario. When we get to the end, we react to it however that goes, and then we engineer it all up so that we can play again.</p><p data-v-24be81d3> &quot;As I list off these potential perspectives, these ways of seeing reality, you relate to all of them without resistance. Because we&#39;re Green Zone. Amongst differing perspectives, we depend on one another. So far, it works. I intuit a hidden symmetry to things, a kind of order. I think the Beacon is waiting for that to fracture.&quot;</p>',21),i=[r],d=t({__name:"Beacon",setup(h){return(u,l)=>(o(),a("div",n,i))}});var p=e(d,[["__scopeId","data-v-24be81d3"]]);export{p as default};
