While trying to gain experience playing in decent bands around town, his great passion was for producing demos.

It was mostly a dream not fully rendered. A lot of why the band ultimately started to happen was this infectious passion that the other members had for what Adam was trying to do. </p><p data-v-b95a129a>We got together because we had in common this love of the strange and absurd, this friendly but rude sense of humor, we had the passion and we loved to play.

There were hundreds of songs, they were generally adapted from demos or just acoustic songs. We were just trying to get good, really. We were constantly rewriting everything, changing the style, adding tricks. Eventually, we were playing shows, and became worthy of interest for local musicians. </h4><a href="https://thesteinsound.bandcamp.com/album/shades" target="_blank" data-v-b95a129a><img class="stu-banner" alt="travels" src="'+R+'" data-v-b95a129a></a><h2 data-v-b95a129a>Travels (2010)</h2><h4 data-v-b95a129a>The first set of material written for Stein.

It would be several years before they would once again have a place to rehearse. There were many versions of Stein that existed in this period, including a version with just Adam and a cellist. Mostly, Adam played in other bands and continued making demos under the name &quot;Junk Tracks&quot;. </p><h3 data-v-b95a129a>A new chapter developed when Adam moved into an art house, with a basement.</h3><a href="https://thesteinsound.bandcamp.com/album/accidance-2" target="_blank" data-v-b95a129a><img class="stu-banner" alt="accidance" src="'+U+'" data-v-b95a129a></a><h2 data-v-b95a129a>Accidance! (2015)</h2><h4 data-v-b95a129a>The Flophouse was an environment of inclusion and social experimentation. Multiple bands of many genres rehearsed and performed in the basement, there were elaborate theme parties, gatherings based around fiction, poetry, filmmaking, and painting. Stein had become a family. </h4><h4 data-v-b95a129a> The music and media itself was crude, as creative control was much looser, but we were experiencing for the first time this sense of having a tribe. We were sensitive outcasts who liked to joke around and talk about deep stuff. We felt an incredible freedom to be our own weird selves, like we were not alone. </h4><img class="stu-banner" alt="movies" src="'+J+'" data-v-b95a129a><h4 data-v-b95a129a> The Accidance! project was a movie on VHS and DVD, with videos for every song, each directed by a different person.

It was a very weird idea. </h4><a href="https://thesteinsound.bandcamp.com/album/shades" target="_blank" data-v-b95a129a><img class="stu-banner" alt="shades" src="'+M+'" data-v-b95a129a></a><h2 data-v-b95a129a>Shades (2016)</h2><h4 data-v-b95a129a>Stein likes to move in opposite directions, and so for the follow-up to the DIY everything goes basement party project, Adam wanted to do something more personally challenging and heartfelt.</h4><h4 data-v-b95a129a>Shades was a collection of &quot;black sheep&quot; songs, demos that seemed like compelling deep cuts from non-existing bands, that all shared a sort of dreamy sarcasm. It created conflict to introduce a disciplined, high concept set with several ballads to a party dance band. </h4><h4 data-v-b95a129a>Nevertheless, what shines through is feminine, vulnerable, and thought-provoking, with moments of fist-pumping beauty, and the production and musicianship is generally competent. Shades is a mirror companion to Travels, the course of the psyche over the landscape of sleep, and the reintegration of that into the complexity of self. </h4><img class="stu-banner" alt="shades banner" src="'+Y+'" data-v-b95a129a><h2 data-v-b95a129a>Opposites Attract</h2><h4 data-v-b95a129a>Stein had stuck together, and learned to be serious. As almost a sort of sorry not sorry, Adam created several sets of comedy dance pop songs explicitly focused on sex. The lyrical conceit was that Stein was a business looking to market sex, with a secret hidden agenda of being a love cult. Sex is an analogy for love. </h4><h4 data-v-b95a129a> The finished album recording currently sits unmastered on a Google drive. Needless to say, it was ridiculous. It took too long to make. The community had moved on. It became imperative that Adam focus more on career.
