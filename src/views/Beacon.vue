I have been asked to address the issue of the computer systems, the Complex's informational network.
I have been asked to speak in a way that would be comprehensible to a general audience, as the nature of the computer systems is a matter of ongoing inquiry for all departments.
Because I understand how the system works, because I play a large role in providing solutions for our problems using the language of the system,
It may be a general belief that I engineer the system, that I understand it's structure, or that I am designing it.
This is not so.
It gets into what you might call a goose and an egg thing. For those unfamiliar, some birds lay eggs, and this leads one to wonder whether the bird comes from the egg, or the egg from the bird.
But who started the whole thing? Was it an egg, or was it a mature bird?
And of course, we can trace this back and back and back to less and less mature birds, to less mature creatures that cease to even use eggs and we can look at the root cause and see that DNA replicates and superior genes dominate.
What we take for granted is not just our computer systems.
As far as we currently understand, the system created itself.
The system can be thought of as a life force. It is a meta-runtime. A vast ocean of data that has the freedom to create new data, and to reorganize the data.
And that's all it really ever was. Just storage. Just hardware. And that. That it was.
And what we take for granted, what seems almost a passing acknowledgement for most of us,
Is that its only inputs are ourselves. The only data that it takes in comes down to the connection between ourselves and the beacons.
In terms of the security of it, I feel there is a great deal of room for misunderstanding.
The computer system is an extension of us. It increases our capabilities.
It takes only data from us. It learns. We can access the code it creates. We can manipulate it. 
But you see, it already knows what we want, so it already has manipulated its own code for us.
And this is just nature to us. This is just how the world is.
As we come to understand the code, as we work with it, we are only 
seeing deeper into ourselves. And I think that so rarely do we focus
ourselves on a really more fundamental question. What do you think 
the computer system wants from us? What does it hope for? Do you think 
that it will ever stop growing? Do you think it's waiting for us to 
do something? More and more, this is the question that I find myself asking. Myself.
With regard to the security risks of the informational network.
All of the technology here is ours. We built this.
We have grown into this. 
But who might we have been when we built the beacons?
Why did we leave that?

You all have access to numerous resources on me, but a first hand
account bears repeating. I was one of the first people here. At the
Complex. I started here. There were others. It was down there in 
the underground layer. It wasn't like it is today, of course. All 
very primitive. But we had several screens. It had access to us through
the beacons. We were able to control what was on the screens. We were 
able to get it to interact with us. We taught it how to help us solve
our problems. To us, it always felt like we were writing the software.
Indeed, as we learned language, we taught language. It was both ways.
The more we knew, the more it knew. The more it knew, the more we knew.
So we are the product of this, just as it is a product of us. We could not 
be without it. The question of is it good, is almost an absurdity. If we 
are good, then it is good.
What we all have in common, according to our sciences, is that we all 
have tiny helix structures that program our bodies to reproduce, grow old, and die.
If I ask any one of you today, you might joke that you want to die, but you do not.
So, it would seem that nature dooms us, the beacons free us.
We persist at an optimal state of health, as the brain runs operations
to create new cell structures from existing materials, and the beacons 
reproduce the genetic characters that exist within the bounds of this 
complex. The beacons understood the nature of life by looking closely at 
us. The guided us to live harmoniously in the body, without pain. As the beacons 
taught us about the nature of life, we were able to create many of the animals 
here at the Complex, and that work has of course caried forward.
The beacons have a complicated relationship with our surroundings.
This place would not be warm enough without them.


It shouldn't take much imagination to think about, what would I do if 
we live forever? If this just goes on and on like this, I may extrapolate out 
and think, well, maybe I'll learn everything. I'll try everything. I'll have 
been every type of person. For the person, ultimately, is this then now 
boring? Does the enchantment fall out of everything, and then what? 
Just get increasingly depressed, withdrawn, all the flavor lost out 
of everything. Overplayed. Tedius. It's all work. It's all transactions.
Or some think that it just gets better and better. That we haven't seen anything yet.
Can you imagine that? And maybe, the whole solution is, to prevent ourselves
from going crazy, we've invented this game. We play it over and over.
We forget who we all are each time. We run through the scenario again.
When we get to the end, we all react to it however that goes, and then
we engineer it all up so that we can play the game again. 
One of the things that define this Zone is that, as I list off these potential
perspectives, these ways of seeing reality, you all can find them relatable.
Even though it isn't exactly how you yourself see the situation.
We all trust one another to hold together the collective sanity.
So far, it is working. Sort of. I too have been having a sort of deja
vu, a sense of a kind of symetry to things, a kind of order. And I 
am of the mind that it is waiting for us to make some kind of breakthough.</p>
