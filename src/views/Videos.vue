        He recorded music demos as Junk Tracks and made comedy videos as Junk Reviews.

        bring a slightly intellectual aspect to a generally more superficial medium.

      <h3>This feature-length comedy film took more than two years to create. And kind of sucks.</h3>
      <h4>About the picture:</h4>
      <p>Thilo, Dustin, and Adam worked together to devize, write, and plan a movie, while living together
        in a tiny apartment with two other people.<br>
        Dustin secured a quality camera and some light and sound equipment. He planned many of the
        locations, originally said most of the inside jokes, and his disruptiveness contributed
        greatly to the parts of the film that were actually succesful in their intentions.</p>
      <p>Adam continuously challenged the group to write down everything funny,
        he urged the group to take every aspect more seriously, he delegated the delegation to others.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thilo was really the brains of the operation. Whatever task he was given, he did it profesionally
        and seriously. Like he was a robot programmed to do just that. Along with Adam, he spurred
        on the absurd, non-sequitor tone of the picture.
      </p>
      <p>We must also mention Sambath, who held the camera and said "Quiet set, quiet set, Qui-set!"<br>
        Which became our faux production team name. Quiset Productions.<br>
        He was also frequently responsible for stunts and dangerous things.</p>
      <h3>All in all, it is friendly and unassuming, and if you can sit through the
        thing, and kind of get into where it's coming from,
        it's a pretty one of a kind film, with aspects that are surprisingly
        smart and funny.
      </h3>
      <h3>It was 100% a, "no, I'm serious - let's quit joking around - let's <em>actually</em> make a movie!" situation.
      </h3>
      <h4>It's amazing to think that us three guys were able to pull together a film production
        using ourselves as the main cast, knowing we didn't know how to act.<br>
        The scenes of our script were mostly filmed and not lost or destroyed.<br>
        We shot all the pages from our script. We reshot several of them.
        We edited and did all the effects and the rock music by ourselves (music by Stein).
      </h4>
      <p>Honestly, we might as well have made a birdhouse.</p>
      <h3>As you might have guessed, they wanted to hone their unique combined sense of humor, to
        recreate the funny, carefree world of Missoula, MT, where everyone is their own weird sort of
        character. A time capsule of simple Summers when young people jumped in rivers.</h3>
      <h2>Join Brandt, the eccentric psychopath Jay, and their friend Todd who is...<br>
        he just kind of does his own thing.<br>
        As they embark upon the perilous journey...<br>
        of getting together with flakey female friends, fun tubes, beer, a Supervolcano Survival Kit, 
        and a time machine.<br>

      <h2>The Stein Band<br> (2011-2017)</h2>
      <h4>
        Stein was a heartfelt experimental rock band whose ever-developing sound was
        called Post-Crunk Poogaze, Psychedelic CyberGrunge, and Disco Sex Rock.
      </h4>
      <img class="stu-banner" src="@/assets/img/Stein.png" />
      <h4>Smart-alecky and rarely polished, Stein performed in bars, garages,
        and basements of the Pacific Northwest for over ten years, generally living together.
        Starting as a multi-instrumental duo, Stein would ultimately court fourteen core members and countless
        lineup miscarriages. What never changed was the purple, green, and black.

      <h2>Lore</h2>
      <h3>Purple and Green are the duality of nature. Purple is this ethereal, weblike
        essence that absorbs perspectives, detects inadequacies, and authentically experiences
        each moment. Green is directed, purposeful, and engaged with the flow of positive action.
        You can consider it like yin and yang, Apollo and Dionysus, left and right brain, additive
        and subtractive, male and female, self and shadow. We mostly exist between these two
        worlds, or lenses.
      </h3>
      <h3>But a funny thing happens when instead of opposing and reflecting one another,
        they energize and focus one another. They amplify, they eclipse, they make love, they create.
      </h3>
      <h3>The Truth, my friends... oh, the Truth.</h3>
      <h4>We looked at a Coke can and realized we should theme our brand elegantly like that.<br>
        After years of coming up with hilarious runners-up, the name Stein was unanimously
        chosen because we had a friend who would make fun of some of our stereotypical Jewish
        tones, behaviors, and rationales, by calling us "Steins."
      </h4>
      <h2>Formation</h2>
      <p>Adam lived a double life as a musician. While trying to gain experience playing
        in decent bands around town, his great passion was for producing demos. For many years,
        he had written hundreds and hundreds of songs, and while he was capable of writing more or less
        conventionally appealing songs, in his own practice, he was drawn towards something else.
      </p>
      <p>Songwriting, and using sound arrangement and production techniques, can be a process
        of revealing the self to the self. These are songs that came out of nowhere and have a
        strange internal symmetry.
      </p>
      <h4>There is nothing like the feeling of writing a song on the guitar,
        recording and producing it like a full band, and then walking around town in the middle of the
        night listening to it on headphones to check the mastering.
      </h4>
      <p>The experience of Stein rarely surpassed the energy of the demos. It was mostly
        a dream not fully rendered. A lot of why the band ultimately started to happen was
        this infectious passion that the other members had for what Adam was trying to do.
      </p>
      <p>We got together
        because we had in common this love of
        the strange and absurd, this friendly but rude sense of humor, we had the passion and we
        loved to play. We worked very hard and took it seriously.
      </p>
      <h3>Stein meant an awful lot to the hundreds of people who were a part of it.üíúüíö</h3>
      <h2>Early Material</h2>
      <h4>A strange period, when we were making Going With the Flow, and we were also rehearsing
        generally around 40 songs, ever changing, every single evening. There were hundreds of songs,
        they were generally adapted from demos or just acoustic songs. We were just trying to
        get good, really. We were constantly rewriting everything, changing the style, adding
        tricks. Eventually, we were playing shows, and became worthy of interest for local musicians.
      </h4>
      <!-- <h2>Travels</h2> -->
      <img class="stu-banner" alt="travels" src="@/assets/img/stein1travels.jpg" />
      <h2>Travels (2010)</h2>
      <h4>The first set of material written for Stein. 
        It is a concept album that attempts to evoke the tone of the
        psyche as it progresses throughout the day from morning to night. </h4>
      <h4>
        Rough around the edges, trying too hard, and often silly, the album nevertheless
        delivers some surprisingly mature riffs and cerebral lyrics, and is undergirded with an
        an insecure but genuinely loving vibe.
      </h4>
      <p>Shortly after completing Travels, Adam and Thilo moved to Portland, OR. It would be several
        years before they would once again have a place to rehearse. There were many versions of
        Stein that existed in this period, including a version with just Adam and a cellist. Mostly,
        Adam played in other bands and continued making demos under the name "Junk Tracks".
      </p>
      <h3>A new chapter developed when Adam moved into an art house, with a basement.</h3>
      <img class="stu-banner" alt="accidance" src="@/assets/img/stein2accidance.jpg" />
      <h2>Accidance! (2015)</h2>
      <h4>The Flophouse was an environment of inclusion and social experimentation. Multiple
        bands of many genres rehearsed and performed in the basement, there were elaborate
        theme parties, gatherings based around fiction, poetry, filmmaking, and painting.
        Stein had become a family.
      </h4>
      <h4>
        The music and media itself was crude, as creative control was much looser, but we were
        experiencing for the first time this sense of having a tribe. We were sensitive outcasts
        who liked to joke around and talk about deep stuff. We felt an incredible freedom to
        be our own weird selves, like we were not alone.
      </h4>
      <img class="stu-banner" alt="movies" src="@/assets/img/Accustomed2.png" />
      <h4>
        The Accidance! project was a movie on VHS and DVD, with videos for every song, each
        directed by a different person. We had raised money on kickstarter promising
        to "swede" donator suggested movies. So, we did Jurrasic Park, Northern
        Exposure, and Twin Peaks. It was a very weird idea.
      </h4>
      <img class="stu-banner" alt="shades" src="@/assets/img/stein3shades.jpg" />
      <h2>Shades (2016)</h2>
      <h4>Stein likes to move in opposite directions, and so for the follow-up to the DIY
        everything goes basement party project, Adam wanted to do something more personally
        challenging and heartfelt.</h4>
        <h4>Shades was a collection of "black sheep" songs, demos that seemed like compelling
          deep cuts from non-existing bands, that all shared a sort of dreamy sarcasm. It created
        conflict to introduce a disciplined, high concept set with several ballads to a party
        dance band.
      </h4>
      <h4>Nevertheless, what shines through is feminine, vulnerable, and thought-provoking, with
        moments of fist-pumping beauty, and the production and musicianship is generally competent.
        Shades is a mirror companion to Travels, the course of the psyche over the landscape of
        sleep, and the reintegration of that into the complexity of self.
      </h4>
      <img class="stu-banner" alt="shades banner" src="@/assets/img/steinshades.jpg" />
      <h2>Opposites Attract</h2>
      <h4>Stein had stuck together, and learned to be serious. As almost a sort of sorry not sorry,
        Adam created several sets of comedy dance pop songs explicitly focused on sex. The
        lyrical conceit was that Stein was a business looking to market sex, with
        a secret hidden agenda of being a love cult. Sex is an analogy for love.
      </h4>
      <h4>
        The finished album recording currently sits unmastered on a Google drive.
        Needless to say, it was ridiculous. It took too long to make. The community had moved
        on. It became imperative that Adam focus more on career. He mostly stopped playing and
        teaching music, and stopped thinking of himself as a musician.
