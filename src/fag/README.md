This is the official website for an unimaginary company with a revolutionary twist on business.
My name is Adam. I'm a holistic person. In Integral Theory terms, this is the Turquoise stage. 
That means that my thinking, feeling, and doing execute most often a pattern
of integrating the various paradigms I'm facing. I point out hidden assumptions and work with
subconscious material, guided by an intuition that the nature of reality is that it is evolving, primarily becoming more self aware,
at an accelerating rate. Each of the twelve major stages of consciousness, or by any scale or metric, the developing being always
faces reality with the capacity for choice. Does it not? What we chose to do with our time and energy, with our life, often comes
down to some very fundamental choices. As you progress through stages of consciousness, there is a growing recognition that these are
all choices. To pursue immediate pleasure, comfort, safety? To justify that? To justify it with sexual attractivness and aggression, symbols
of wealth and displays of power, being the person with authority, in control? To play ball, get with the program, work the system?
To carve out your own little piece of heaven, to have some skin in the game, to participate in the dialog, to represent, to influence? 
I have just explained the motives of the stages leading up to the second tier. So, what motivates the Teal and Turquoise stages?
Well, that all of those prior priorities are ultimately hollow. 

BODY
I've conquered my addiction to candy by having to worry with full responsibility
for my teeth and digestive system. So, my social system tantalizes me with sugar forever, and I eat as little of it as I can, and now
my body feels deprived at times. But I'm not a body. Plus, when I feed this thing a Reese's, it just wants another one. And I can feed it
until it gets sick. So, the Reese's is transcended. It isn't the key to everything. You can eat one, or not, but probably don't. You might
as well just eat healthy, based on health science and what's available in your budget and area. But now my body wants things, and so I just
pump it full of drugs? No, health science. Drugs are unhealthy. Being addicted is neurotic. Those things are neurotic. What's the real problem?
Why does existing feel uncomfortable for your body, when you live in a relative heaven of comforts. Let's go deeper.

PERSONALITY
How am I being all the time? If you talk to a counsellor of any sort, they will get you looking at how you talk to yourself, and the tone in which
you do so. I find that there's this personality in me that is disapproving, saying that I haven't done enough, that I can't ever get what I need, that
I can't handle what's to come, I need to push harder, I need to fight. All day long with this shit. Where is this coming from? This is my superego, my
internalized parent. And so, I hurt myself, and then I feel emotionally troubled. And so I engage in self soothing behavior. Coping mechanisms. My personality,
the character that I approach the world with, becomes this servant of pacifying my petulant self. This is why I started feeding myself unhealthy foods and
addictive substances. So, I become this character with this narrative, as I approach the world. There's always a danger of other people influencing me, enabling me, back into these behaviors. Why? Because the personality is very flexible, very responsive. If you normalize not responding to something, that becomes your norm. Don't be surprised if you are then surrounded with things that you don't respond to. This is quite the pitfall. This is the nature of
toxicity. We see no real solidity to the personality, but rather, that it requires continuous work to develop the proper personality for getting anything done.
A person has a sort of natural personality, an inner child, and this can be regressed to, it can be integrated, and it can certainly be suppressed. Most work
does not require us to be a child. However, being a child is important to the integrated adult. Your psyche is built upon that of your child self. You want
to really know yourself, your history, your past. Know them, see them. Know they are not gone but here, and when they're gone you won't miss them. For this
advanced personality work, we get into our personal systems of magic. And how to inter-relate with yourself.

EGO
Who you are. What you ultimately are after. What you're up to. This is the mind. The language mind. The public agent. In a way, it is like a secret agent, 
donning the disguise of each of your personnae, but seeing everything. If you are like this, you exist at the stage of ego. Do you identify with a personality,
or with your mind? The personality identity is generally childlike. Most adults act pretty aligned with ego at least some of the time. Ego forms at stage 3, Red, and comes to dominate the self sense, or personal identity affinity, until finally gaining self-reflective awareness towards the top of the first tier with mature Orange and Green stages. A more mature adult ego will produce a personality that gives away and reflects an appropriate amount of ego. It may have layers of boundaries and privacy and personal relationship roles to consider. Children lack ego and many of these considerations, and may
behave spontaneously, without consideration. This is an incredible source of physical and mental energy. The development of healthy ego upwards is to bring
the sense of personal drive and desire into alignment with one's highest values. The ego must truly be understood to be a story, with a particular tone at this
time, with particular themes and noteworthy characters and interactions. armor was manufactured by genetics and by the dark and brutal history of the planet Earth. 
The ego projects the past into the present, it transforms purpose into progress. This
is why ego development is so important. This is what our school systems are supposed to accomplish. This is the benefit of a "quality upbringing", truly. The
healthy ego is a rare and precious gem. At second tier, we are creatively manifesting personality, grounded in history but free of it. The ego as rational agent must fulfill its developmental arc; the hero's journey myth. This is the nature of ego. So, how to go beyond. Well, understand that this knight in shining armor is actually your responsibility to guide. The development of the ego is the digestion of the history of thought, is mapping the Kosmos of the collective consciousness, and finally, to ask oneself these ultimate questions. To make Judgments. No really: What do I actually think? You have all this knoweledge, all these references, you are a unique special snowflake of abilities... now, what do you have to offer? The only way to learn your own code, write your own program, is the introspective path, the inner eye, and this leads us to the psyche stage.


I call this helping people and fixing things.

We are the business that we want to see.
One approach to holism is killing all relevant birds with an appropriately wrought "Stone", so to speak.
The second tier character aims to consolidate all the disparate aims and intentions and work. To focus. 

How can I prove to the world that I am a software developer, music teacher, media producer, and holistic philosopher?
Who would take me seriously

We live in a computerized world. This is the meta. What is happening is happening because you're letting it. 
We create the Future.

My life has felt belittling. 
I live amongst people who want to be blameless, as opposed to good. 
They have no pride or self worth. They are like the spider. They weave and they scheme, we all see what they're doing. 
I've never been the spider. If you were there, you saw it.
I've come to do an experiment. A bargain. Let's say I not hold myself back at all, and I'll ask the world whether it will
be possible for me to live life on ethical terms, based on reasonable, mature values.
We value Integrity, Development, and Spirituality




unLimitedTime - A clock and calendar system compatible with Stein Unlimited.
Future of Sales - A self help rock opera dramatisation of Stein Unlimited.
unThinkMe - Exploring philosophy and spirituality in today's world.
Beacon - A Web-based collaborative science fiction story.


This is the official home of Adam's high concept science fiction work, entitled Beacon. This web-based collaborative
telling with be the ninth version of the story.  
Each of the eight rewrites, taking over a decade, were opportunities
to learn aspects of craft. 
The only existing version at present was the first part of a "Revelation
Complex" trilogy, starting with "The Spiral Stairs", published by Blue Skirt Productions in Portland.
As the story has developed, the medium of a paper novel has ceased to make sense. This is the work of a software
and yoga guy, not an author. And hopefully, you will come to respect me as a storyteller. 
As a writer, Adam chose to just focus on making on really good idea perfect, and just
rewriting that over and over, as opposed to exploring other genres and stories.


This is Adam Loewen's official website for Stein Unlimited, unThinkMe, Beacon, and the Future of Sales.
