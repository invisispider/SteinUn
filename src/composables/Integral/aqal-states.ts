    'ordinary': 'Throughout our normal lives, ordinary people experience a host of minor States, but all of us experience at least three Major States of consciousness: waking, dreaming, and deep sleep. Each of these Major States is You, experiencing reality in radically different ways.',
    'beta': 'During the day when we take care of responsibilities, we use the awake, alert, responsive, productive Beta brainwaves. These brainwaves are maxing out our resources, and they can lead to stress, cynicism, and poor health. We require rest! Or else we\'ll start talking about Gamma waves.',
    'alpha': 'When we are in a more mellow or playful state of mind, we show more Alpha waves. Deeper in this range, we reach the edge of sleep (hypnagogic state). Alpha is absorptive, synthesizing, and creative. Sometimes, to solve a problem, you just need to take a break.',
    'theta': 'Early meditation trials showed meditators entering Alpha brain states, but it was discovered that more advanced meditators get into Theta brainwaves. These are brainwaves that dominate the dream state and show up more heavily in children. The Theta state is indicative of access to Subtle states of waking up. However, for most of us, we only enter this state while dreaming. Some of us have no dream recall, some of us have good dream recall, some of us lucid dream every night and approach Theta states each night with the same awareness and recall that they have throughout the day. These all tend to coarise. This is the level of Psyche, Your Identity as Psyche. It\'s everything you know and everything you don\'t know. Sweetest dreams and worst nightmares. Most ordinary people do not typically enter Theta states consciously. Those people tend to be spiritual, but may also simply be soulful, gifted, uneven, or perhaps just a healthy inner child.',
    'delta': 'Delta is the baseline hum of us as a living being. We experience a small amount of Delta (all by itself) when we are in deep dreamless sleep. Totally unconscious. It turns out that the most advanced meditators in particular traditions (and also Ken Wilber), are able to consciously access pure Delta States while still awake and aware. This appears to be the physical basis of what is commingly called spiritual enlightenment. To experience Consciousness itself, without any forms or content or anything, is to see the truest and deepest version of yourself, and also the world. That the two are one. That you and every other living being are identical at this level, and thus the actual nature of yourself is that you are the life of the Universe. This part of you exists before anything, it exists always. You are it. No matter what happens to your body, no matter what happens in your story, this thing is simply there, watching, and that\'s the actual truth. Those who experience constant consciousness through waking, dreaming, and sleep, 24 hours every day, experience being at every level, awake or at least present, all the time. And so this sort of Nondual being is considered the ultimate form of enlightenment. To describe this sort of thing in plain language completely fails to convey States that take decades for most people to access. Words do not convey what it is to vibe with the entire cosmos and perceive the oneness of all existence, but this isn\'t just an idea. It has been observed and reported all throughout the world and all throughout history. It may be any number of things, but it isn\'t fake.',
    'brainwaves': 'There is a strong desire for transpersonal mystical States to provide scientific backing. One thing that is evident and easily comprehensible is EEG scans. We can explore the different Branwave ranges and how they correspond to the Major Ordinary States of consciousness, and also how those might correspond to the overlapping comparitive religious progression of milestones along the path of waking up, transcendental mystical States as outlined in many traditional and alternative schools.',
    'being': 'The Simple Feeling of Being is common to all moments, even when you are unconscious. This simple feeling is actually the deepest and truest part of your self, it is your true identity. But we are conscious of a person, through a person, through other people, and so we have learned and we have been trained to never access these States of utter freedom and bliss, creative brilliance, weeping joy, and other-worldly visions. Integral suggests that State practices are available to all people, not just dead or religious people, but that these classically spiritual states of consciousness will become more commonly practiced, and will produce new stages of human development. In other words, religion and romantic idealism sees spirituality in the past. Integral sees it as the future. Perhaps the primary backbone of future progress. But looking back, it does seem that these very same spiritual States were implicated in the creation of our culture, our religions, the entire story of history, the nature of the self, and the nature of the Universe.',
    'state': 'In this column, we are specifically talking about a generalized progression of State-stages, that is, stages of States, which is classically achieved through spiritual practice, typically meditation. Each of these States can be thought of as a Body, or Realm, as they entirely occupy your sensory experience and awareness while you are practicing successfully. Each of these States can be experienced by any one at any time, but to acquire them as Traits, or to be able to access the State at will at any time, requires a very intense effort to achieve. Each is experienced as a sort of reversal to the rules and the nature of reality. Each is often described as an epiphany, a communion with a higher identity or being, often intense, harsh, terrifying, disruptive, but nevertheless resulting in the person feeling as though they have awoken from a dream into a greater reality, that they are able to face everything they were never able to face before, that this experience was intensely life changing and impactful.',
    'gross': 'This is our typical awareness. Our body. The material environment. Our personal concerns and worries, our stories, our people of interest. Our work. Our activities. Our stories. All the stories that everybody has. This is the gross realm, or State.',
    'psychic': 'Not to be confused with paranormal abilities, it means psyche-aware. At this point, a person may maintain bodily thought and awareness, but a sort of daydreaming causes them to identify more with consciousness and their total holistic and ideological environment. If Psychic States are practiced regularly, a person becomes considerably more lucid, they may display forms of genius and high vulnerability. Psychic States, as the gateway to deeper practices, can be shocking, startling, and terrifying. They can lead to re-traumatization experiences, bizarre bodily phenomena, and general spooky stuff.',
    'subtle': 'The Subtle is an entire realm of pure mind. One way to hypothetically describe this state is that it is like dreaming while fully awake. Both parts are on at once. It takes a long time to enter, discover, and maintain these States. This is deep into the practice. A person who spends a lot of time in Subtle States is psyche-aware. They are self-aware of how their reality is constructed by stories and memes, or archetypes.',
    'causal': 'This is the most Subtle, or Causal, realm or level. A person in this State will show practically no Beta or Alpha brainwaves, and they will describe dropping out of body and mind and becoming the pure essence of reality itself. This is the typical form of spiritual enlightenment, ultimate oneness, the experience of gnosis or godhead. The self truly sees, once and for all, that it is nothing else besides the self, looking at the self. The Witness. No matter what happens, this is here, everywhere, forever. I am this. Infinite. Empty. Everything and everybody you know, every story, this whole dang thing is You. You crawled out of the ocean, you set this whole thing up. It\s very funny. It is definintely not words, though, and it is definintely not knowledge. Talking about it is only to attempt to translate a State to another State.',
    'nondual': 'It\'s always a little funny for a middling student of meditation to attempt to describe the ultimate culmination and fulfillment of the practice. But this is what Integral is all about. It is to shed some basic light, and lend some basic categories, to this whole thing that is the ultimate freedom, the ultimate bliss and surrender, the ultimate meaning of life, the universe, and everything. I will attempt to utterly spoil the story for you, with the understanding that I\'m not entirely sure that I stayed awake through the second half of the picture. The Causal State reveals the ultimate essence of the self and reality, a sort of singularity. The Nondual State practicing individual, is then integrating the Causal State into Waking, bringing that State into the world, as the world, as the most active agent and the most passive, emotionally-invested observer. This is a fully awake, fully enlightened person, if they stay that way, all the time. It seems to be marked by constant consciousness throughout waking, dreaming, and deep sleep, and the ability to silence the entire brain at will. It is exceedingly rare.',
    'identity': 'As a transcendental mystic accesses higher States and State realms, it is common to hear descriptions of changes to the sense of self and identity. These changing State identities are here standardized into common, non-religious wording. They follow intuitively with the Brainwaves and transcendental State realms.',
    'personality': 'Identity with Personality is typical of Children and those up to Red Meme. The personality is the character that you are playing in the present moment. Children have no self-monitoring, so they are pure personality. Much of the work they are to do is to gain self-awareness in order to understand and control their impulsivity. As adults, we use personalities in the roles that we play to fulfill our responsibilities. If overused, a person can start to feel self-less or ungrounded. Being pure personality as an adult is not well tolerated.',
    'ego': 'The ego, or I, is a self-aware, reasonable agent. It understands its motives, it loves and hates and respects and tolerates, it governs the use of personalities, and it is ever focused on the way that it is perceived, appreciated, and responded to by others. Ego is neither good nor bad; ironically, only Ego could judge it so. The ego can be any character imaginable, as all the people out there... are egos.',
    'psyche': 'Disruptions in the psyche lead to mental illness, and so psychologists such as Freud and Jung attempted to map and comprehend its intricate depths. As you begin to gain awareness of how the psyche functions, you can see that it is the source of your thoughts and emotions and the stories of your life. It is your style, your dreams, your soul. A person who begins to identify as Psyche, or is Psyche-aware, having Psychic States of consciousness, has fairly direct consciousness of their own process of constructing reality. Psychosis is the Psyche coming squirting out into the Ego space. It is senior to Ego. It contains Ego. So really, the Psyche is the self. The self includes more of the subconscious and the unconscious, and an awakening view of the present moment.',
    'consciousness': 'There is one thing that is always here, whether we are waking, dreaming, or deep sleeping. That is consciousness. Did you think you were dead? Naw. If I kick you, you\'ll come right up. Something is awake, listening, and that\'s actually the root of who you are. It is a witness to this. The simple feeling of being. Common to all sentient creatures, ever birthing and evolving forms. It\'s You.',
    'creation': 'I Am and have always been the creator of the Universe. Or rather, it is being me. And You. And everyone else. We are the self-aware Universe, in fact. The singing and dancing planet Earth. If you could spend eternity, in utter infinite formless nothingness, You would not. You are here. I\'ve gone into many people, and now we\'re all fighting with one another. If we can begin to understand the nature of consciousness, and the nature of enlightenment, to prioritize being awake and conceptualize as being the self-aware Universe, this is a sort of rough and dirty monomyth describing, or modeling, States of consciousness.'
