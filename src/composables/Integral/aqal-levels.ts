        the social attitude is perhaps applied towards nature, so that the world becomes \

        to be clever and strong and powerful and fair and sexually attractive by modeling the father, the hero, the villain, the seductress, \

        the height of the Personality \

        suffering, for the equal sake of warrior, victim, and leadership. Programs of desensitization stunt \

        immediate preference for self, or selfishness. In children, this is displayed when they \
        begin to resist, defy, or even deceive the parent. For many of us, this rebel \
        without a cause attitude mostly dissipated in our early teens. We may recall \
        hesitantly our petty youthful acts of rebellion and vandalism, our stunts and perversions and \

        low class, and there\'s no politically correct way of saying this, but Red is \
        generally racist, sexist, noncooperative, and has strong, unfounded beliefs. When we say selfish \
        here, we do not mean Orange\'s rational, self-maximizing ego with high self-esteem and \
        a benevolent worldview. We mean narcissistic, impulsive, making reactive decisions \
        that serve immediate momentary needs but are ultimately self-destructive. Turning \
        to global matters, we see that genocide, slavery, trafficking, lawlessness, \
        powergod despot kings, terrorism, and narcissistic myths abound as the governing principle of \

        In our culture, individualism \
        is a given, as our fundamental faith and belief (or myth) is that a person can know reality \
        through reason, logic, and education. We are typically educated in schools \
        that teach science, math, history, language, what amounts to a liberal education for  \
        a citizen of a nation, and Orange is more or less expected of us. \
        Rationality and objectivity have a global, \
        as opposed to regional, appeal. Orange has moved \
        into the abstract and cerebral Right Quadrants, and the notion of universal governing principles (the LR) \
        ought to be compatible with repeated observation (the UR) by qualified individuals (UL) and these \
        will be validated by a community (LL) of competent peer review. The essential thing to understand \
        as a rational person reconciling yourself with pre-rational beliefs and superstitions of others, is that until \
        you are personally developed to Orange, you just don\'t conceptually \"get\" the notion of the LR, \
        and so the idea of proving something true doesn\'t really mean the same thing to the mythic believer, \
        who is compelled to accept only those notions which feel morally correct "in the heart," which Amber never did figure out \
        spreads oxygen and does not think. \
        It actually takes most of childhood in a quality school to become a genuine rational person capable of \
        deducing the laws of nature. Amber believers keep their children out of quality schools that \
        teach rational facts and methodologies that apply to the real world and contradict tradition. \
        Once you have personally made the turn to a more or less rational Level being, it becomes tough \

        well as higher. Orange is far from the top. You have configured yourself, for the first \
        time, by assembling myths and testing truthiness, into a being that can comprehend universal \
        abstract patterns, and so you have all four Quadrants fully differentiated. \
        The best articulation of Orange \

        you did every time before. Find a different rationality, and integrate it. We deconstruct the edifice that \
        has produced our rational self, our rational world, and this becomes Green. We listen to the critics, \
        the ignored, the dismissed, the oppressed, the disposessed and unseen. Meanwhile, Orange invents \

        All heirarchy is insensitive, as some people are lower and higher in a \
        heirarchy of measurable maturity, for example. Instead of investigating what this Levels thing is all \

        It appears to be more the case that Teal is an invisible hand operating \
        upon and within the First Tier. Second Tier efforts and sentiments are apparent in the world now, but \
        there is nothing resembling a culture, social order, or movement. Teal appears to resist assembling that way. \

        see everything as overlapping, interwoven evolutionary systems. We can attempt to make some generalizations \
        about how to spot Teal. A person at this stage will often have many interests, some of them highly advanced, \
        often considered both highly intelligent and highly intellectual, worldly, experienced, and \
        well read. They often present in a bland, nondescript way that says as little as possible. They are \
        warm, lucid, often ironic or humorous, calm, measured, patient, thoughtful, emotionally intelligent, and socially giving. \
        They may also be seen as weird, \
        eccentric, intense, inscrutible, overly cerebral, judgmental, or trying too hard. They often express some interest \
        in rational forms of spirituality. They tend towards highly progressive lifestyles, often with specific diets, \
        exercise programs, therapies, numerous hobbies and activities, and often a massive workload. The certain \
        indicator of Teal is when they draw charts and tables everywhere that help them to explain \
        to themselves how they entirely understand something.'

        it is the structural essense of thought itself, a true map of the construction of reality. \
        While again, not everyone at these Levels has access to this chart or these concepts, Teal is \
        aware of something resembling Levels, perhaps only intuitively, and Turquoise is aware of the whole \
        Integral Theory, though again that might not mean Ken Wilber\'s version of it. Just as Orange scientists \
        can squabble and debate over particulars and ultimately be on the same page at the rational Level of consciousness, \

        the world, a diety. This can lend a sense of subtle radiation or aura, an extreme sense of novelty in the mundane, \
        a childlike sense of profound wonder and vulnerability. These states can be accessed within months of daily meditative \
        practice for most people, or can occur spontaneously, through intellection and will, and through communication. \
