        In our culture, individualism \
        is a given, as our fundamental faith and belief (or myth) is that a person can know reality \
        through reason, logic, and education. And of course, we have largely all been educated in schools \
        that teach us science, math, history, language, what amounts to a liberal education for  \
        citizen of a nation, and so Orange is more or less expected of us. \
        Rationality and objectivity has a somewhat \
        universal appeal. Notice that in terms of cognitive functions and Quadrants, we have moved here \
        very sharply into the abstract and the cerebral, and the notion that universal governing principles (the LR) \
        ought to be compatible with repeated observation (the UR) by qualified individuals (UL) and these \
        will be entered into a community (LL) of competent (UL) peer review. The essential thing to understand \
        as a rational person reconciling yourself with the beliefs and superstitions of others, is that until \
        you are personally developed to Orange, you just don\'t conceptually \'get\' the notion of the LR, \
        and so the idea of proving something true doesn\'t really mean the same thing to the believer. \
        It actually takes most of a childhood in a quality school to be a truly rational person capable of \
        comprehending the nature of reality, and so believers keep the children out of quality schools that \
        teach rational facts and methodologies that apply to the real world and contradict the tradition. \
        Once you have personally made the turn and become a more or less rational person, it becomes hard \
        to relate to pre-rational, of course, but this perspective is to legitimize those lower Levels, as \
        well as the higher ones. Orange is not the top, for sure. You have configured yourself, for the first \
        time, by assembling myths and testing their truths, into a being that can comprehend that universal \
        patterns, or rules, apply to our reality, and so you have all four Quadrants differentiated fully. \

        can be found in Ayn Rand\'s philosophical literary fiction, which \
        also portrays the darker side of the Orange perspective quite well. \

        has allowed you to see any certain truth at all. Don\'t attach to it. Don\'t cling to it. Do what \
        you did every time before. Find another rationality. Integrate that. We deconstruct the edifice that \
        has produced our rational self, our rational world, and where this will lead. We listen to the critics, \

        Integral Theory is an expression of Teal, and every stage tends to villianize the previous. \
        Thus Integral often leans heavily on the negatives of Green, which is in turn highly critical and dismissive \

        people publically associated with Integral Theory. Unconsciously of course, Green thus "labels" Teal as inferior people \
        or inferior values or inferior perspective, because it considers some people inferior. Green cannot \
        be made to see this performative self-contradiction, just trust me on this one. The most common irritant \
        of Teal is trying to share Teal with Green. There\'s a reason these are two different stages. Teal can \
        understand Green. Green can\'t understand Teal. The deconstructing mind is unable to try on a perspective \
        like Teal can, so no matter what Teal conveys, Green will go after sources and try to psychoanalyze the \

        control, and putting people at Levels is just to make Teal feel special or superior. What Green will not \

        it is the structure of intelligence. The structure of meaning. The structure of reality, including physical. \

        aware of something resembling Levels, perhaps only intuitively, and Turquoise is aware of Models, or the whole \
        integral theory, though they may again understand these things rather differently, just as two Orange scientists \
        can squabble over particulars and ultimately be on the same page at the rational Level of consciousness.',

        This is the highest stage included in nearly any Line stage system, and this is because a random sample of people \
        might yield Second Tier Levels at a significant enough rate that Second Tier could be detected. Third Tier is so \
        rare that even if people at these Levels did show up in a sample, they would stand out as extreme outliers and would \
        go into the slush pile with people who scribbled all over the assessment, tore it up, or put the same answer for every \

        tends to measure low Alpha and Theta brainwaves, suggesting a somewhat dreamlike waking experience, and is often \
        described in terms of a dissolution of boundaries and identities, a sense of waking up to oneness with the environment, the body, \
        the world, a diety. This can lend a sense of subtle radiation or aura, an extreme sense of novelty in the mundane, \
        a childlike sense of profound wonder and vulnerability. These states can be accessed within months of daily meditative \
        practice for most people, or can occur spontaneously, through intellection, through will, and through communication. \
        If a person is generally coming from the Second Tier, and they learn to regularly access this state, so that their Psyche \

        safe to assume that Psychic States have always been relatively commonplace. Legitimate Psychic State-specific \
        practices remain active mainly in the context of indiginous spiritualities, as well as in alternative, new age, and \
        occult interests and therapies. Psychic States appear to have played a major role in the formation and administration \
        of Magenta and Red Meme Civilizations, often guided or led by priests, priest-kings, god-kings, sorcerors, shamans, \
        prophets, oracles, and seers, who often underwent intensive State practice training, including rites of passage, vision \
        quests, trials, and snake taming. At any rate, we are suggesting that the path forward from Turquoise naturally leads \
        to this plasmoid State of the mind, the psychic bands, where our most primitive assumptions are dissolved and understood \
