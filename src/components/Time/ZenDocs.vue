            Got a case of the Mondays? <br>
            That's one seventh of life.<br>
            Want to <em>do</em> something about it?
        </h3>
        <h1>Welcome to unLimited Time.</h1>
        <h4>
            Why is there Monday?<br>
            Calendar says so.
        </h4>
        <p>
            Surely, there's some logical reason why a week is seven days, like the span of Creation in the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ancient religious empires made it so you work so much that you're unhappy one seventh of the time.
        </p>
        <h3>
            And once you see it... there's no turning back.
        </h3>
        <h4>
            zenDate "12022, Tues, Flowers 6 Tues"
        </h4>
        <h3>
            Let's definitely keep the whole weekend.<br>
            And the latter half of the week is nice.<br>
            Tuesdays are all right.<br>
            After careful consideration, Wednesday's out.
        </h3>
        <p>
            With this five-day Cycle (like "week"), you can work "more than full-time" 
            like most professionals - four out of five days a Cycle.
            If one day off isn't enough, switch to a three-day work Cycle: two days off. 
            The Cycle doesn't tell you how much to work, it gives 
            you the flexibility of having options because people have their "on" and "off" Cycles.
        </p>
        <h4>
            There was no reason for seven-day weeks. Five is easier to do math with.<br> 
        </h4>
        <p>
            Would it be easier to figure out how many times five or seven go into 365?<br>
            For example, we generally consider the year to be 365 days.<br>
            Most of us also know that it's slightly more than that, and so 
            every four years we have to insert an extra day at a random point.<br>
            There are several sneaky things like that going on.
        </p>
        <h4>What unLimited does is, the sneakyness is out in the open</h4>
        <p>unLimited Time unapologetically runs on top of standard computer dates. It's a library, or lens.</p>
        <p>We have ~zen~ periods. These occur at the end of the year and the middle of the night.</p>
        <p>Thus, our time will integrate all of their sneakyness, but declare the time period when the sneakiness is 
            going on - while we're sleeping, and when the sun's gone. zenSession.
        </p>
        <p>This affords us a great deal of leeway. It lends us slack, rather than insertion.</p>
        <h3>How many days should we have in a year?</h3>
        <p>
            Well, I think that 360 happens wrap around a circle pretty well. Great.<br>
            Seasons are kind of circular.
        </p>
        <p>Both 360 and 365 divide into 5-day Cycles. <br>
            Thus, there are 72, (or 73 with zenTime), Cycles in a year.</p>
        <h3>Now, an interesting thing starts to happen....</h3>
        <p>Every Year starts on the first of a Cycle.<br>
            Every Year starts on the same day of the Cycle (Sunday).</p>
        <p>
            Every day of every year is the same Day and the same Date as every other year.<br>
            Except zenTime.<br>
            If you think about that, it's actually a bit crazy.
        </p>
        <h3>But we're just getting started making things simple.</h3>
        <p>
            Here's a really cool thing about 360. <br>
            It divides cleanly by 2, by 3, by 4, by 5, by 6, and by 8.<br>
            Now we can simply apply the logic of angles to the days of the year.
        </p>
        <p>
            We all know from doing stunts that half of a 360 is a 180.<br>
            So the year has a halfway point at 180 days.<br>
            And we know that 90 days is one of four turning points of 360.<br>
            These are the solstices and equinoxes.<br>
            90 days is pretty long. About three months (since months are inconsistent.)<br>
            And let's divide those into 45 degree (or day) turns of the year.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>
            Introducing Habits.
        </h3>
        <h4>
            A Habit is 9 Cycles, 45 Days, and half a season.<br>
            There are 8 Habits a year.<br>
        </h4>
        <p>
            Forty-five days is about how long it takes to establish a lifestyle habit, 
            for something to normalize, or to make a consisent connection.<br>
            You could use the first of every Habit as a Holiday to choose the next habit-forming period.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>What about months?</h3>
        <p>
            Months have weird old names and don't really mean anything or correspond to the moon.
            They are all different amounts of days for 
            no reason. <br> 
            You don't have to memorize a poem to know how many days are in each Habit.<br>
            We are wasting our children's time.<br> 
            And what's up with Holidays? The sneak up all over the place - they never happen at a predictable time!
        </p>
        <h3>No more guessing.</h3>        
        <h4>The Holiday (generic) is the First of every Habit. And zenTime is the New Year.</h4>
        <h4>
            What to name the Habits, if not dead people?</h4>
        <p>The Holiday is always on the first, so 
            let's distill traditional holidays into a universal and fundamental essence,
            and that will name both the Habit and the Holiday.
        </p>
        <b><p>1 Struggles</p>
        <p>2 Flowers</p>
        <p>3 Elders</p>
        <p>4 Memo</p>
        <p>5 Peace</p>
        <p>6 Harvests</p>
        <p>7 Hallows</p>
        <p>8 Feasts</p>
        <p>~zenTime~</p>
    </b><p>
            These are generic open-source Holidays that can be used as defaults, or whatever 
            observances you may have in your own tradition. Holidays are given 
            general, secular names, as I don't want to push a single tradition or mythology 
            on the rest of the world. For example, you can call 
            your Feast day Thanksgiving, and carry those connotations. We call 
            it Feasts.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is not in any way to discourage traditional observances, rituals or 
            practices. It is only to set a public tone that all people can celebrate together in 
            spite of differing views. The newZen is everybody's newZen. We are talking about 
            simplicity, not religion. Holiday names were granted in a manner 
            similar to how George Lucas conceived of the force; take what Holidays generally are 
            and then call them that. These are "mono-myth" or meta-Holidays, and can be used 
            for any purpose (while recommending topical themes.)
        </p>
        <p>
            You can spend the Struggles with your family, spend it drinking and crying,  
            spend it fasting and praying, spend it partying. It's just called the Struggles.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Seasons are sensible, and will be kept. In fact, more so. 
            </h3>
        <p> 
            Months are archaically tied to moon cycles. While it would be nice 
            to track the moon, the feminine, and the surf better, moon cycles are really basically 
            incompatible with the length of the year.<br>
            You have to ignore years if you want to track the moon. Not worth it.</p>
        <p>
            We've moved the solstices and equinoxes by no more than two and a half days (zenTime.)<br>
            But now we know when they are.
        </p>
        <p>
            We rarely conceptualize the days and years wrapped around a seasonal circle.<br>
            unLimited Time allows you to draw a circle with a + and an X in the middle.<br>
            You have Habits, and also the seasons, and you can further divide them into 
            forty-fives and fives to see the entire Calendar wrapped around a circle, which is 
            not a new idea but may seem exotic for those accustomed to a grid layout.
        </p>
        <h2>The unLimited Clock system</h2>
        <h3>
            We now look at the various ways that the clock can create stress.
        </h3>
        <p>
            Hours are crazy, really. An hour tells you what time of day it was. It refers to the position of the sun, 
            and thus what people are generally doing around that time. But why do we have 24 
            of them, in repeating twelves? 
        </p>
        <h4>Ten-fingered people work well with 
            powers of ten.</h4> 
        
        <h3>Why 24 hours: 60 minutes: 60 seconds?</h3> 
        <p>The answer is no.</p>
        <p>
            It's arbitrary. <br>
            When I think of a day in its totality, I usually come up 
            with ten or so sessions. <br>
            Let's call them Sessions.</p>
        <h4>A Session is our version of an hour.<br>
            They are modeled after a noticeable change of day or event.<br>
            Their names are what an average person might call that time of day.

        <p>
            Minutes are also arbitrary and difficult to work with. What is a minute?<br>
            I remember things 
            in terms of 10-15 minute "whiles."
            Each with 10 "moments."
            Each moment was maybe like 80 "instants."
        </p>
        <h3>10 Sessions: 100 Moments: 80 Instants</h3> 
        <p>Why are there 80 Instants (Seconds) rather than 10?</p>
        <p>You can work out the math yourself, but a second was designed to work with weird 
            numbers. What I've worked out is actually a mathematical hack.<br>
            For you math nerds: 
        </p>
        <h3>Greg Day: 24 * 60 * 60 = 86400 seconds<br>
            unLimited: 10.8 * 100 * 80 = 86400 Instants
        </h3>
        <p>
            The clarity of unLimited Time comes at the cost of a couple quirks.<br>
            Up-front sneakiness.<br>
            For subtle clarity.
        </p>
        <h3>Plan your schedule</h3>
            <p>A <b>Session</b> is one tenth of the day.<br> 
            Roughly the total length of a meal period.<br> 
            Or an activity, a focus, most events,<br> 
            most interactions and activities, movies, changes of weather.
        </p>
        <h3>Situational awareness.</h3>
        <p>
            When you tell a story, you describe a progression of Moments.<br>
            A <b>Moment</b> is the time in which something happens, or things stay 
            the same.<br> 
            Moods and attitudes exist in the Moment. <br>
            A thought or feeling or train of thought or point often lasts a Moment.
        </p>
        <p>
            How to handle seconds? No need. While seconds are 
            arbitrary, it is essential to have a fine time-keeping unit, and seconds and milliseconds 
            behave admirably. unLimited Time remains compatible with Gregorian 
            time, existing systems, software, and hardware.             
        </p>
        <h3>
            Sessions, Whiles, Moments, Instants. That seems like a lot, right?
        </h3>            
        <h3>Well, recall that these names are already commonly used this way.<br>
            We've quantified them.</h3> 
        <p>
            Sessions are decimals, like dollars.<br> 
            Moments and Whiles: pennies and dimes.<br> 
            A Moment is 1% percent of a Session.<br>
            A While is 10% of a Session.<br>
            A Moment is 10% of a While.<br>
            A Session is 10% of a Day.<br>
        </p>
        <h4>To make it all work, that's why we have zenSession and 80 Instant Moments.</h4>
        <h4>In case you were wondering.</h4>
        <h4>Behold the benefits of a base-10 system mod.</h4> 
        <p>
            It may seem confusing at first.<br> 
            Consider how long it takes children 
            to understand the clock and the calendar, how hard it is to pronounce everything, how 
            complicated and silly notions of "quarter-to" and "o'clock" seem to the uninitiated. 
            <br>How many people can tell me what PM stands for? Not many. <br>

            Aren't there a lot of hidden problems with a system like this?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The short answer is yes, but this fixes many of them. Since it is generated from standard time 
            with Daylight Savings, timezones, leap years and even leap seconds (time is itself 
            relative to motion, unfortunately) unLimited Time is able to flex its focus more on emulating the 
            human perception of time, and systematizing it an orderly and intuitive manner.

        <h3>Intuive comprehension of human life: better recall, better time containers.</h3>
        <p>
            Instead of hiding stuff and pretending it isn't weird, we acknowledge and embrace it each day.<br>

            compulsively.

            This is where we lovingly place the Instants, Moments, and Whiles that don't conform to a base-10 grid.

        <p>
            Outside of ordinary time, where time does not flow. That's part of the day. You can 
            break it down to Instants, and see the strange little joke that theres 80 Instants 
            in a Moment and 80 Moments in a zenSession. But quantifying the practice is discouraged.

            It's difficult to conceptualize the historical state of the world, the simultaneity

        <h2>When did Years start happening?</h2>
        <p>
            Pre-Christian times are made difficult to conceptualize, because you're adding
            a negative number thousand BC, plus the two thousand years it's been AD. We don't 
            want this to be the year 4 Billion, like StarDate. It really isn't 
            meaningful to talk particular years twenty-five million years ago. 
            A particular year in prehistory is indistinguishable from another.

            so that this year that I'm writing this is 12024, which you can shorthand 2024 or 24.  
            Historical dates look similar, but no more negatives. We're not thinking back from today, 
            but forward from the beginning. 
            Nothing happened on a specific negative date. We can 
            say, "eighty thousand years ago," and it's historically the same as the next and previous year.<br> 
            There was nobody documenting anything.<br>
            unLimited Time begins and ends with documenting, or history.
