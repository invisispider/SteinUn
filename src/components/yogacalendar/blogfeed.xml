    <title type='text'>Lost and Found</title>
    <content type='html'>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I found a journal today. I should say, it found me. It was green, plain as the eye could see, but although it sat in the same spot for days, today was the day it called to me, and became
      found.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It once belonged to a man named John, a Sergeant in the military, dated 2012. It contained one entry, &quot;Ideas for Stories.&quot; They were all related to war happenings; one titled,
      &quot;It was all fun and games until they brought the dead body in.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Other than that list, just a handful of pressed leaves from Fall the year he found himself at the Love Shovel. Which
      illuminates why today was the day.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I woke up, pushing the door open to be caressed by the brisk air of Autumn. I woke up quickly, stared up at the sun and took a huge breath. I couldn&#39;t help but
      smile. I know so many people who lament and torture themselves with the idea that Summer is the only truly beautiful time to be alive.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &quot; That&#39;s it. We&#39;re doomed.&quot;&lt;br
      /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; What I felt this morning was an affirmation of change and existence--- no matter what we do as humans, the beauty of impermanence. The insistence of change to color our lives. I also felt the
      heat and intensity of the Summer peel off my being and drain into the rain soaked dirt.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve always considered Fall my favorite season. It is a time suited to my temperament---new beginnings, beautiful
      leaves, most importantly, a time where the sun takes a few steps back and allows my fiery pitta self to breathe and absorb vitamin D without sweating profusely. I had a bit of an obvious in hindsight epiphany today: Summer can be a pretty angry time
      for me. All the heat mixed with my already heated body, mind, soul....of course it makes me more volatile! I am not suited to such climes. Summer is extreme for me, I&#39;d be better off in the snow. Antarctica?&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
      &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m contemplating moves, as I always seem to do at or around season&#39;s change. I don&#39;t see myself in Colorado any longer than my beloved Fall, and beyond that, I am drawn to NYC-why? YOGA.
      I&#39;m not questioning it. But what happens in between is, as always, a bit of an adventure. Or a lot of adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So, dear friends and perhaps even, not yet friends (YET being the operative
      term), I am on the loose once again and soon.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Where shall I go on the in between? I&#39;m wide open. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://mechanicaljigsawpuzzle.blogspot.com/feeds/3153189035599206661/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://mechanicaljigsawpuzzle.blogspot.com/2015/08/lost-and-found.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7399844385828655698/posts/default/3153189035599206661'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7399844385828655698/posts/default/3153189035599206661'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mechanicaljigsawpuzzle.blogspot.com/2015/08/lost-and-found.html' title='Lost and Found'/>
