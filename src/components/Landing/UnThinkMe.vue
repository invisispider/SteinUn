        <h3>With fearless vulnerability and bad comic timing, our goal is to popularize Second Tier modes of thinking, feeling, and doing.</h3>
        <h3>Tune in to tutorials and podcasts breaking down <RouterLink to="/landing/IntegralTheory">Integral Theory</RouterLink> 
            and exposing groundbreaking new applications.
            We have the attitude that this information should be available and accessible to everyone.</h3>
        <p>We're avid students and outside observers of Integral Theory
            (never said we were right😋) simply showing you a glimpse into the intellectual
            lives of a vulnerable group of close friends who are intelligent in different ways.
            We argue over whether enlightenment is useful, whether Integral is helpful, what it means to be crazy. 
            We mostly agree that it's a little strange that one of the most compelling thinkers of 
            the last century is relatively obscure to contemporary thought, even as we all ask the same
            questions.
        </p>
        <h4>We're doing this experiment concerning whether
            Integral thoughts, values, and lifestyle are appropriate for an ordinary everyday millenial.
        </h4>

        <p>Transcend and include body, mind, and spirit in self, culture, and nature.
            Face shadow. Be self-aware. Listen. You'll never have better friends than the ones
            you grew up with. Let's grow up together. Let's be fearlessly awake, truly being 
            our actual selves in public. Let's re-engage with our most serious questions,
            talk honestly about our lives, and explore some very strange territories within the realm of the supposedly ordinary and mundane. 
            Let's normalize unmistakable loving kindness, compassion, and respect for the dignity
            of all sentient beings. <b>Let's not hold anything back this time.</b>
