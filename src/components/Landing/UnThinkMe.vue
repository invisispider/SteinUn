        <h3>Plot</h3>
        <p>High school friends Adam and James come together from very different 
            paths to share an intellectual podcast about philosophy, meaning, and values 
            in today's world - without taking the topic, or themselves, too seriously.

        </p>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <!-- <h3>With fearless vulnerability and bad comic timing, our goal is to popularize Second Tier modes of thinking, feeling, and doing.</h3> -->
        <p>Tune in to break down <RouterLink to="/landing/IntegralTheory">Integral Theory</RouterLink> 
            and expose groundbreaking applications. unThinkMe brings
            Second Tier into everyday conversations and ordinary topics,
            making Ken Wilber accessible to a wider audience.

            <!-- We argue whether enlightenment is useful, whether Integral is helpful, whether 
            holistic thinking is healthy. 
            We mostly agree it's strange that one of the most compelling thinkers of 
            the last century is relatively obscure to contemporary thought, even as we continue asking the same
            questions.

            Integral thoughts, values, and lifestyle are appropriate for an ordinary everyday millenial.

            you grew up with, so let's grow up together. Let's be fearlessly awake, truly being

            talk honestly about our lives, and explore some very strange territories within the realm 
            of the supposedly ordinary and mundane.
