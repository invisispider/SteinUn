        <h3>Ken Wilber's Integral philosophical framework has been the subject of his 
            best-selling, globally-translated books since the 1980s.
            His grand "Theory of Everything" synthesizes the history of human thought, culture,
            and values into a grand vision of a kosmos devoted to infinitely unfolding evolution 
            and an ever-escalating awakening of spirit as consciousness.

        <p>In spite of an intensely positive niche 
            response, Wilber's work is often dismissed as overly mystical, cerebral, insensitive, 
            or non-academic. However, in topics of meditation, human potential, 
            and consciousness evolution, Wilber is celebrated <em>precisely for</em> bringing 
            intellectual skepticism, postmodern sensitivity, and analytical grounding to this
            perennial field of human endeavor. 
        </p>
        <h3>Integral Theory exposes how people comprehend the nature of reality 
            and the experience of being with the AQAL Map: a system of visual diagrams
            which model the nature of reality and the developmental flows of human
            consciousness, derived from synthesizing academic, literary, and esoteric sources.
        </h3>
        <p> 
            Starting from the premise that every perspective is correct 
            at least through it's own set of lenses, the course was then to map out the definition and
            nature of lenses, and to organize and categorize the lenses that are known.
            One thing which becomes clear is that transcendental development is central to the nature of lenses,
            and historically, human nature has been to deny or suppress this observation in
            many ways.

        <img class="stu-banner" src="@/assets/img/AltitudesModel.svg" />
        <p>Instead of defining the nature of a supposed given reality, 
            Wilber deconstructs our various lenses, or modes of perceiving reality,  
            revealing the limitations and biases inherent to each in an 
            elegant developmental stage system, and offering a concentrated 
            version of the perrenial wisdom echoing across cultures throughout the history 
            of life: that you are the eternal conscious mind of the Universe, 
            one without other, one with all manifestation, and this human memory story person 
            arising within you is in fact only a view through the very set of lenses in question.

        <h3>Transcend and Include</h3>
        
        <p>Higher, deeper, more evolved, developed, or inclusive, do not necessarily mean
            personally or morally superior, 
            wise, mature, or smart. There's nothing smarter, more lovable or blameless, 
            than a newborn baby. The purpose of the baby isn't to grow up, grow old, and die. A baby is an end in itself.
            So says a moral stage far beyond a baby's comprehension, and thus it becomes the responsibility of the higher stage 
            to make sure the baby's diapers get changed. It becomes your responsibility, quite naturally, 
            to try and get the baby up to your stage, so you no longer have to take care 
            of the things the baby is unaware of that are problematic to you.</p>
        <p>If moving up Levels means any one thing, it means greater responsibility.
            The challenge is not to get to the highest Level, or even the next Level. 
            The challenge arises from recognizing the intuitive reality of this developmental heirarchy and 
            where your primary stage expression exists within it.</p>
        <h3>A new tide is rising: the Second Tier, or Integral Stage, of human development.</h3> 
        <p>Integral thinkers (Second Tier stages of consciousness, Teal and Turquoise Altitudes) view life and reality in terms of the holistic 
            evolution and inter-relatedness of memetic paradigms. Civilization, nature, and the mind
            are complex developmental systems, interpenetrating and co-accelerating their mutual evolution towards 
            greater complexity, inclusiveness of perspectives, and self-awareness
            (which is sexually attractive.)</p>
        <p>What is unique about Second Tier is that we value the authentic 
            embrace and inclusion of all Levels, we nurture healthy 
            development for all, and hopefully assist in some way with the  
            irreconcilable apocalyptic conflicts of First Tier reality. </p>
