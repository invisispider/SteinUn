        <!-- <h4>What is the nature of reality?</h4> -->
        <p>Ken Wilber's philosophical framework exposes how people comprehend the nature of reality and the experience of being.</p>
        <p>Second Tier or Integral thinkers view self, culture, and nature in terms of the holistic evolution of systems. </p>
        <p>We are open to beliefs and opinions, universal-doner personalities, actively engaged with fearless emotional vulnerability, detatched from identity status.</p>
        <p>Right now in every moment you are consciousness. Of reality. They include one another. We are one and the same.</p>
