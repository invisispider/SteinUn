        <p>Time is limited.<br />Why not make it unLimited?</p>
        <p>A revolutionary and logical way of knowing when it is.</p>
        <!-- <p>Questioning the basic assumptions of our current clock and calendar resulted in greatly simplifying it.</p> -->
        <!-- <p>Instead of 24 of 60 of 60 units not corresponding to how we perceive time, how about Instants, Moments, and Whiles, which are based in powers of ten?</p> -->
        <p>Units that work like dollars and percents rather than strange and varying.</p>
        <p>How about knowing when every season change and holiday is?</p>
        <p>How about a work week which eliminates the days we don't like?</p>
        <!-- <p>How about simply counting in your head how many days since any other day?</p> -->
