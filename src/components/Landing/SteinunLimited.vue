        <h3>Our core values are <b>Integrity, Development, and Spirituality.</b></h3>
        <p><b>Integrity:</b> Being good, true, and beautiful according to your most realistic understanding
            of what those mean.</p>
        <p><b>Development:</b> Getting better at anything, 
            particularly being open-minded, discerning, aware, and compassionate
            towards the diverse characters in your actual life. 
        </p>
        <p><b>Spirituality:</b> To be an active agent in your story, to practice being awake, to be appreciative and grateful 
            or at least reasonable, to not hold yourself back, to take responsibility for 
            feeling driven with purpose, feeling supported and whole on an existential level, no matter what.

        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>You can think of it as an ARG (alternative reality game), where I'm
            actually being fully genuine and operating in the real world as a fictitious businessman,
            making real money, solving real problems, helping people and fixing things.
            The goal of the ARG is for the business to succeed. It's very fun.
            <em>To whatever extent</em> we're still getting away with this, Stein unLimited lives!
        </p>
        <h2>üëÅÔ∏è Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I'm an organic conscious developmental system integrating numerous inter-related passions. 
            I'm attempting to maximize for doing things that I've learned to do well, according to our brand values.
        </p> 
        <h2>The Pitch</h2>
        <p>People say to me all the time, what's this whole thing all about? This thing you've been doing
            with your whole life. <b>What's it all about?</b> Let me ask you a serious question: 
            What's this all about in your <em>wildest dreams?</em>
            That's what it's all about. Isn't it? There's nobody 
            <em>more</em> concerned with what it's all about than we are. 
        </p>
        <h3>I'd love to share something personal with you.</h3>
        <p>Everything a person does is motivated. Typically, the motive is unconscious, hidden,
            or dishonest. It's our pleasure to interact in a forthright manner.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have always sought the remarkable and the underlyingness in things. 
            Every time something hurts me, I learn to do new things. I play the blues. I call it 
            a Love/Art Spiral and it's entirely to our benefit. üçãüëâüèøüçπ 
            Creative projects can transmute demoralizing experiences into expressions of meaning and value. 
            Our platform is shifting focus towards providing meaning and value to others.
            We've created a program entitled The Future of Sales. The thing only starts up if one of us feeds it money - which isn't a bad thing. üòâ Just how it is.</p>

        <h2>Our Story:</h2>
        <h3>A long, long time ago, a decreasingly imaginary Turquoise corporate entity was born.</h3>
        <p>A lost and discouraged young man finally looked the universe in the eyes and asked some serious questions.
            In his imagination, Stein came and spoke in a language as intimate and reassuring as it was inscrutible
            and universal.
        </p>
        <em><p>You are not the one You are by accident. Not a coincidence. I've scouted You. 
            Your participation drives the business. You're the one
            that must be trusted to be a moral agent. You were there, you saw the whole thing.
            You can listen to others and imitate others, and they have compelling reasons for what they think, feel, and do.
            When you're most awake, when you're most receptive, you see that every moment is the opportunity.
            You're forced to make judgments. You're forced to make sacrifices. You're in a game created by logic. Matter attracting matter. Falling.
        </p>
        <p>And the whole thing about You, the thing that makes You the most special You in the whole cosmos... 
            Is that You have, inevitably, 100% total creative control over how this thing goes down.
            You can learn how Your body and mind and the world work, how to stay awake with an open heart,
            how to recognize the continuous joy of embracing Your ultimate and final responsibility for this experience.
            You can give Yourself over to that, stake Your damn livelihood on it. This is Your life. This is Your world.
            You decide who are the heroes and villians. You say whether You believe in something or whether
            that's all bullshit or You can ask questions and progress the story.
            You're the perfect example of a human being. I'm giving You permission. I believe in You.
        </p>
        <p>You are welcomed, encouraged, and invited
            to be an ego. I want You here. Everyone wants You to participate.
            I want to see You learn to sing and dance. I want You to be the happiest and most proud
            ~Head of Sales~ that You can possibly be. I was there. I saw the whole thing. And I love You.
            You deserve this. We work together to help people and fix things. This is the business.
            <br>~disConnectors!~
        </p></em>
        <p>And so the young man sat beneath a tree and listed out on paper all the things that composed the story of his life.
            The things that made him who he was. The treasures of his heart. The entire past and all
            his plans for the future. He shredded up the many pages and threw them into 
            the river for somebody else to clean it up.
            And he arose, nothing and no one. Naked, many many years in the Future, without fear.
            The story was over. His heart was "broken."
            Shredded up. In the river. <b>He was ridiculous.</b> He swore an 
            oath that he would face everything and he would not hold himself back from being ridiculous. 
            He defined a brand. 
            <!-- And he said, "Being ridiculous is not a game to me, friends.It's who I am and what I do." -->
            And he erected a humble storefront with a sandwich board which read:
