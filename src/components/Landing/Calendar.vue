        <h3>A revolutionary and logical new way of knowing when it is.</h3>
        <!-- <p>Questioning the basic assumptions of our current clock and calendar resulted in greatly simplifying it.</p> -->
        <!-- <p>Instead of 24 of 60 of 60 units not corresponding to how we perceive time, how about Instants, Moments, and Whiles, which are based in powers of ten?</p> -->
        <p>Units that work like dollars and percents rather than strange and varying.</p>
        <p>How about knowing when every season change and holiday is?<br>
        How about a work week which eliminates the days we don't like?<br>
        What if time keeping could be simple, elegant, and supportive?<br>
        What if it promoted our mental and physical health?</p>
        <h3>We created and use the <RouterLink to="/Time">unLimited Time</RouterLink> clock and calendar system.<br>
        It simplifies the way that we plan and organize our schedules.<br>
        It improves our memory.<br>
        It speaks our language.</h3>
