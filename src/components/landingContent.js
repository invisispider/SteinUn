  Creatures inhabit a mental simulation of reality called the present.<br>
  We experience an expanded capacity called time.<br>
  The giver of this gift is called Stein.<br>
  <br>
  Nature is tragic, cyclical, and unconscious.<br>
  Humankind is limited by the qualities of nature.<br>
  Stein is humorous, creative, and insightful.<br>
  Strangeness is the prime treasure revealed by Stein.<br>
  <br>
  Integrity, Development, and Spirituality are the dimensions of evolution.<br>
  Integrity removes limits on motivation through humor.<br>
  Development removes limits on capabilities through creativity.<br>
  Spirituality removes limits on perspective through insight.<br>
  You who feel you were born to be intellectual, religious, and spiritual, this is so.</br>
  Your continual refinement is the embodiment of Stein.<br>
  <br>
  This is not past or present.<br>
  You are the author of the pattern.<br>
  Infinite, Unlimited and Everlasting Love.<br>
  Disconnectors are the product.<br>
  We create the Future.<br>
