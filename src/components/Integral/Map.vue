        <h3>Our Level of Consciousness</h3>
        <p>
        This is a diagram of reality attempting to encapsulate and 
        express a <b>Second Tier,</b> or Integral, perspective, which is considered the 
        highest stage of consciousness widely available today. Wilber 
        offers a complete Second Tier philosophical system, and so Integral synonymously 
        refers to Wilber's work, the Integral stages of consciousness, and any expression 
        of those.

            It's uncommon to appreciate the need for a reality map, how 
            literal this is meant; to get at a glance, or even a deeper look, 
            what this model actually accomplishes and means, what it implies, and what it

            as well as the structural dynamics of the known kosmos.

        <h1>Integral Theory</h1>
        <p>Philosophy author Ken Wilber has 
            made a career out of writing sophisticated and accessible books covering the 
            vast reaches of this mind-expanding approach to thought. His various institutes
            and academic programs offer superior resources. We consider ourselves
            a delivery method. 
        </p>
        <!-- These should actually be video presentations -->
        <h3>What does integral mean?</h3>

        <p>Commonly, integral implies something is an important part,
            or a necessary aspect of the whole. Integral Theory is 
            entirely focused on parts and wholes, claiming that the most fundamental 
            "part" of reality is something which is simultaneously a whole and a part, 
            termed a Holon.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of us know the term from calculus,
            where the integral is a sort of function that generalizes the other 
            functions under consideration. In integral calculus, you are 
            using inductive reasoning, finding the core connecting patterns from the 
            functions given. 
        </p>       
        <p>Integral theory or philosophy means the same thing. It is a style of thinking 
            that attempts to reach the most basic and deep structural truths, or the nature 
            of reality itself, via an exhaustive process of laying out all of the existing 
            answers or truths or philosophies out side by side, and attempting to organize 
            them logically. This has been done, to produce the concept of Five Modules 
            (AQALALATAS). As we return to the more ordinary deductive and procedural realities
            that we mostly face, we now have a map of the infinite other possibilities and 
            perspectives available at all times.
        </p>
        <h3>Physics and A Theory of Everything</h3>
        <p>
            Integral challenges the common 
            conception that the fundamental particles of physics are in fact the building 
            blocks of reality, or that a theory in physics that unites relativity and 
            quantum mechanics should be considered a "Theory of Everything". This is 
            a narrow view. Since Integral Theory includes consciousness and culture, 
            which are real but do not have mass, electrical charge, volume, or 
            spin, Integral is the better contender for the title Theory of Everything, as 
            it also includes the physics of material reality. 
        </p>
        <h3>Reality is a 4D stack of Levels</h3>
        <p>
            And not talking about spacial dimensions, but Quadrants.  
            We see reality is not a massive mound of fundamental particles, but those 
            particles stack and arrange into various levels with unique dynamics and 
            mechanics, all flexing and flowing with one another. The nature of  
            particles is of great interest to technology,
            but not particularly meaningful philosophically. More importantly, at every scale 
            of size, the "building blocks" of that Level have their own novel, emergent structure 
            and dynamics. The cells of my body 
            "integrate" into a body. We discovered cells, and 
            this opened up a new world of comprehending biology and medicine. We discovered 
            genes. Then you take the derivative of cells, you step in one holonic 
            scale level, and you find that cells are integrals of molecules.
            And the rest is chemistry. Of course, molecules are made of atoms, are made of subatomic
            particles, are made of quarks. We'll get there, just keep digging.
            But what we can say about reality, at every Level - atoms, molecules, cells, people, etc. 
            Is that these are holons, 
            because whole atoms are parts of whole molecules, which are parts of whole cells. It is 
            more true to say of your physical body that it is a stack of holonic Levels, than it is 
            to say that it is a collection of organs, a story of a woman named "Stevie," or the vibrations
            of eleventh dimensional super-strings. But wait... while you weren't 
            looking, we've 
            gotten so small, that ideas of "seeing something 
            happen" and "which direction it is going" appear to stop making the same kind of 
            sense that they do in the scale of reality that we are familiar with. Thus, the startling
            answer, if one can be derived from this, is <em>not</em> that one day, we will find 
            the tiniest thing that makes up everything but is utterly incomprehensible because it 
            exists in basically a different reality, but rather, our reality has always appeared to 
            consist of things which are made up of more basic things, and which themselves comprise 
            more complicated things. This is to say that reality is not constructed of particles; it 
            is holonic in nature. It is hard to say what advancements in quantum theory or 
            relativity may mean to the nature of reality. Surely something, probably startling 
            and amazing. However, what is already always available to see is that in all cases, reality 
            is holons. It is a developmental process unfolding over time, experienced as a relationship 
            between an individual consciousness existing within a collective, and an objective material
            reality composed of individual objects created by the individual and collective consciousness,
            as well as the holonic stacking nature of reality itself. This is the nature of reality 
            as understood by the "ordinary" State of consciousness, in which I am an ego trying to 
            persuade you that what I'm saying will fulfill your ambitions in order to fulfill my ambitions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Integral thought does a very similar move, 
            charting a system of generalizations that can be used as basic orientation 
            points across professional fields, cultures, and contexts.

            It means holistic and 
            inclusive, also often dialectical. 
            In a survey of psychological concepts and 
            models of consciousness, Wilber discovered that Integral was the 
            most commonly used term to describe a new stage of consciousness, typically the 
            final stage in these models. For discussion of the Integral stage, see the 
            Levels page. Importantly, Wilber's work is an attempt to create a sort of 
            philosophical groundwork, a manifesto, or just an introduction to the Integral 
            stage of consciousness, and so the word Integral will most likely forever be 
            nothing more than a reference to Ken Wilber. Whether or not the Integral stage 
            identifies itself by the word Integral, or whether Ken Wilber will ever be 
            recognized as a forefather of a massive global movement, for our purposes, it is 
            most important just to judge the plausibility of these stages, and observe that 
            the integral stage which exists in reality is mostly unaware of Wilber and Integral 
            Theory.

            The influential theoretical 
            advances of eastern mystic Sri Aurobindo also self-referred as Integral Yoga.


            and so didn't coin the term per se, certainly 
            his philosophy moves to identify as Integral as an expression of the philosophical 
            meta-meme, or meta-paradigm, of this emergent stage of human consciousness termed 
            Integral.

        <h2>The Nature of Reality</h2>
        <p>As a through-line, consider the question, "What is reality?"  
            Consider asking all the people you walk past, you work with, all the people you 
            know, all around the world, famous people all throughout history. <b>What's real?</b>
            How could you organize <em>all of that</em> into a simple expression of what is?
            And faced with each of these people, what would you say, if you had to explain it all?

        </p>
        <h3>Sounds Impossible</h3>
        <p>
            But each day, we are expected 
            to go about life as though we are morally responsible for comprehending reality. 
            Are we? Can we articulate it in plain words? No. We avoid
            the topic of reality, because when we communicate openly, we fight.
            When you say impossible, I hear possible.  
            It gets personal, political, religious - hey! 
            I'm just asking the most basic question there is. It's for a friend. 
        </p>
        <h3>It's for any old baby. 🐣</h3> 
        <p>I asked chatGPT. It said we don't know, then listed various dominant 
            overlapping and competing theories of reality under 
            the categories: Philosophical, Religious/Spiritual, and Scientific. A decent answer. But of course,
            notice I wasn't asking, "What does everyone in the world think?" I asked, "What is the nature of 
            reality?" Not... 😡 big dense books. This. Reality. What is it? Why would AI not know what 
            reality is?
        </p>
        <h3>The Mental Prison's Blueprints</h3>
        <p>
            The Integral framework is a global put-in point, a most-zoomed-out view possible: 
            an entire map of reality as understood by humans. It tells you not only what 
            you already know, but what else there is. It's not the content of 
            who you are or what you think, it's just an optimized set of containers. The containers 
            are not traps, they are developmental opportunities with apparent growth vectors.
            <!-- With this 
            basic interface, this orientation, you can be sure to include some 
            reference to every existing aspect of reality, including parts you're not familiar with,
            and not give a partial, reductionistic, or self-excusing answer. -->
        </p>
        <h3>A Fingerprint of Wisdom</h3>
        <p>In each Module, we explore a core pattern 
            of nature and mind, and this may be considered "spiritual," as it 
            pertains to topics that are termed that way. We gladly embrace and re-own this term,
            but with the note that this comes from a place of utmost empirical skepticism
            towards belief systems. The Integral spirituality is not magic and 
            myth, and requires no faith. For those who are spiritual, we hope that Integral will 
            help to lend context and conceptual support to your experiences and beliefs. We as a 
            brand consciously own and embrace our own versions of magic and myth, and find them to 
            be healthy and valuable within their domain. The majority of what is considered spiritual 
            in this context pertains to permanent changes to a person's regular brain functioning and felt
            sense of reality and identity, usually as the result of meditative practices.
            These practices are typically discovered within and best upheld by the religious traditions.  
        </p>
        <h3>Hey, This Is Like Some Other Thing...</h3>
        <p>
            It is the other thing. The Five Modules are entirely
            matter-of-fact observations and concepts we use 
            intuitively in today's world. Insights pertaining to spirituality apply equally to all religious, 
            spiritual, and atheist or agnostic perspectives. Wilber's work is a grand synthesis; practically no 
            aspect of it is entirely original, and nearly everything
            represented in this model derives from the overlap of numerous credited sources which might or might not
            find Integral Theory agreeable. What is unique and creative to Wilber's work is his selection, curation, and framing 
            of these academic, literary, and esoteric sources,
            the way he organizes and categorizes them, and the scope of the entire articulated vision. 
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
            For most people, Quadrants, Levels, and States are intuitive 
            and familiar, but we generally have not seen them stated in this way.
            Types and Lines are considered more in the domain of conventional psychology and 
            social sciences. What Integral contributes to those is mostly the inclusion of 
            the others. We consider Lines and Types helpful but somewhat incomplete, as contemporary approaches
            (DSM-V classification, Myers-Briggs, Piaget cognitive levels, enneagram, Astrology, Hawkins scale...) attempt to exist
            as isolated systems and classify some aspects of consciousness without regard for others. 
        </p> -->
        <h3>How does all of this relate to the Map?</h3>
        <p>All of what is being conveyed here, Integral Theory and all, is Level 7, typical Teal Meme. It couldn't 
            be more on the nose. This is our message. The 
            expression of a Second Tier culture is a genuine, personal call to Wake Up, Grow Up, and Clean Up. 
            Spirituality, Development, and Integrity. It is a call to Transcend and Include - to take a step back 
            into the abstract and hold the apparent as sacred treasure. AQALALATAS is the Level 7 map of reality.
            Most people don't have it. Level 7 wants everyone to have it, and to use it.
        </p>
        <!-- <p><b>Quadrants:</b> People generally and correctly describe reality as:<br><br>
            <b>1 UL "I"</b> My present consciousness, memories, stories, sensations, feelings, thoughts.
        <br><b>2 UR "It"</b> This present environment, my brain and physical senses, things we perceive.

        of life.
        <br><b>4 LR "Its"</b> The Universe, the world, the system, civilization, evolution.
        </p>
        <p>Thus, in explaining reality in commonsense words, we must say that the nature of reality 
            is that it occurs simultaneously to us as these four Quadrants. Language is structured very 
            close to perception, so not surprising that we conjugate our language into "I," "We", 
            "It", "Its" - 
            first, second, and third person, singular and plural, the way we experience reality.

        <p>
            This also means that the four common answers above are incomplete, unconsciously 
            partial and limiting views of reality, and a full answer would include all four 
            perspectives. 
            Integral is not making up the Quadrants and trying to convince you they exist, we are 
            revealing that we experience the Quadrants already, and suggesting that they actually 
            don't exist.😉

        <!-- <p>Now, you may think that I've just delivered "the" integral presentation, but it really isn't.
            It really honestly is the best answer I can give you to "what is reality?" According to

            while there are deeper and higher truths, these are not paticularly suited to words,

            Now, since we can all acknowledge that all four Quadrants are real, as described above,
            then it follows that any view that doesn't acknowledge to co-existence of all of them,
            is a partial view. In order to describe the way that humans understand the nature of reality,
            I had to explain the Quadrants.

        <!-- <h2>Who Integral Is For</h2>
        <p>You may be tempted to believe that Integral is one thing, only to find that you  
            are taking a narrow view. Again, we can use the Quadrants to explain what Integral is.
        </p> 
        <p><b>Upper-Left "I":</b> Integral is a map for self help and personal development.
            It explains how to improve one's moods, relationships, and lifestyle, how transcendental
            states of consciousness work, what they reveal, and massively helps in the development 
            of personal insight and mature self-concept.
        </p>
        <p><b>Lower-Left "We":</b> Integral is a subculture, a values paradigm, a worldview, aimed 
            at reconcilliation and inclusion of those extant. According 
        to Integral's own map of reality, Integral is a Level, which 
        can also be called Second Tier or Teal according to the Altitudes system. If all of
        this makes sense to you, to precisely that extent, you are Integral.
        Truly, no Kool-Aid to drink. If a map of the way humankind understands reality is 
        recognizable to you, you are part of the Integral "We."</p>    
        <p><b>Upper-Right "It":</b> Integral is a relatively simple, comprehensive philosophical theory of reality, bringing
            new solutions to age-old questions, and showing how the history of 
            thought all fits together. Ken Wilber's writing, in particular, applies very 
            directly and progressively to the following fields, often simultaneously, 
            to name some major ones: psychology, religion, spirituality, economics, 
            sociology, anthropology, philosophy, literature, politics, gender studies, 
            death and grief, humor, poetry, history, metaphysics, art. Integral applies to every 
            aspect of reality, so in explaining Integral, you end up covering most topics.

        <p><b>Lower-Right "Its":</b> Integral is a tool for seeing how fields and systems are inter-related
            in a grander scope. Thus, it applies to every field of endeavor, and is best used as a universal 
            translater, a way of applying one field to another, a way of checking in with every aspect of the big picture.
            At a deeper level, the Integral post-metaphysics suggests that one of the best generalizations
            that can be made about reality is that it's a developmental system appearing to occur 
            in four dimensions (Quadrants.)
        </p>    
        <h3>It really isn't a weird new age cult thing?</h3>
        <p>Here is the deal. We have a map of reality. According to the map, human 
            individuals and human civilization, at the second, third, and fourth Levels,
            or stages, comprehend reality to be magical and mythical, they use symbols and 
            stories as their lens. Some of them are us, when we express those stages, those 
            capacities which of course do exist within us. They are familiar, having existed 
            throughout recorded history, banding together 
            into tribes of belief in magic and myth. The fifth Level developed out of mythical
            culture, and introduced an Orange lens, or meme, that said that the nature of reality 
            has to be factually proven by an expert, everyone can find their own truth, we'll 
            engineer our world and govern ourselves. There's no such thing as myth or magic.
            Integral is not here to say which of these perspectives is "reality," but rather to 
            say that in the mind of individuals, and in society and culture, magic is a low stage 
            of comprehension, myth is a middle stage of comprehension, rationality is a higher stage.
            Rationality is globally agreeable, while myth is regional and often racial. To put it 
            bluntly, a cult or religion of Integral is even less likely than the Church of the Spaghetti
            Monster and Subgenius of stages 5 and 6. They are respectively a proof of absurdity and 
            an ironic influencer stunt. In any case, the social model of cults and religions applies to 
            the lowest stages, considered as far from Second Tier as possible. That must be clear.
        </p>
        <h3>Naming the wrungs of the evolutionary ladder.</h3>
        <p>
            The culture appearing before us today includes some magic and myth. The main currents 
            of it are Level 5 rationality and Level 6 Green Meme internet and social media culture 
            of influence, sensitivity, and inclusion. We live in a rational world, deconstructing 
            itself and often succumbing to its own worst impulses. If you see that all of this is 
            happening and want to help do something about it, then you are Level 7 Teal in terms 
            of your motives.
        </p>
        <p>Integral is not an attempt to legitimize mystical, religious,
            or spiritual thinking. It just happens that these are extremely common, and we might 
            say, pyschologically healthy and sociologically natural, ways of thinking - more 
            natural and more historically normal by far than rational or science-based thinking. 
            
        </p>
        <p>Another thing happens at Level 7. We see that Levels exist, and there are more than 7. We 
            are about in the middle, here.

        <p>What is reality?</p> -->
            <!-- <p> 
            nature of reality, as understood by humankind right now.</p> -->
        <!-- <p>Ask this question, and people might describe the structure and origins 
            of the physical universe, they might describe "the world" and history, they might describe 
            their own personal understanding and experience, or they might talk about universal truths 
            and values. Right? What we reveal here is twofold 1) that people answer a question firmly 
            with one quarter of a common knowledge understanding 2) that we understand reality to 
            be four-dimensional from our own perspective. Reality always includes an individual with 
            an interior and exterior, who belongs to a collective which also has an interior and exterior.
            This description of the Quadrants Module may seem exotic at first, but keep it simple:
            what reality is, is that reality has an inside and outside, and it occurs at an individual 
            and collective level. When we conjugate our language, "I", "We", "It", and "Its", we again 
            show that we know the Quadrants intuitively, if not explicitly. Those conjugated pronouns 
            refer to the subject of each Quadrant.

        <!-- <h3>Explain reality in a very small space 😜</h3> -->
        <!-- <h2>The 5 Modules</h2> -->
        <!-- <h3>1 Quadrants</h3>
        <p>The way that we conjugate language says a lot about how we perceive reality. Reality can be 
            described as an "I", a "We", an "It", or a system of "Its". What is real? I: this experience you're 
            having right now? We: all the 
            experiences of all people are real? It: this room I'm in right now is real? Its:, the universe that generates
            this room and me is real? The Four Quadrants illustrate
            how a singular "holonic" source unfolds in and expresses all four dimensions simultaneously, rendering all 
            four quadrants equally and entirely real. A holon, reflexively, is anything that expresses in all four Quadrants 
            - and since reality is the four Quadrants, this means that everything real exists in all four Quadrants and is 
            a holon. Everything not real, by any standard, exists in some Quadrants, but not all.  -->
            <!-- People understand reality to be the <b>interior subjective</b> experience of "I",
                in relation to an <b>external objective</b> reality "It". A human is both a physical body with 
            a brain emitting waves,
            and the ongoing story of a self having awareness, thoughts, friends and enemies, and dreams. These can be considered 
            the "two sides" of reality, or interior and exterior dimensions. Reality is the interaction between them.
            
            The "It" realm is composed
            of systems and groups of "Its." A human is both an individual, and a member
            of <b>collective external</b> civilization. Both are correct. Every human is an example of a human, and this is true
            of everything. Instances are produced by systems, and arise as groups. No person 
            could exist without the civilization that produced and raised them. Returning to the 
            internal, we recognize that nearly everything we know was taught to us. We speak, and 
            think, in a language that we learned as toddlers. There is also a "we" nature to reality, 
            for example, consider the difference between what "I" know and what I can look up on the 
            internet. The knowledge, thoughts, opinions, perspectives of others is a large part of reality 
            for everyone, and so we consider this the <b>collective internal</b> part of reality, the "we." -->

        <p>If there is some existing reality, some objective factual truth, then really, 
            we are limited from knowing only by our awareness. Being human 
            imposes enormous limits on what we can know about reality. 
            
            There are probably aspects 
            of reality that a human cannot know, and so, our knowledge of reality can only ever be 
            an expanding work in progress. Rather than speculate on the nature of that great, given, 
            objectively factual pure reality, the Integral model traces the developmental course 
            of human thinking, both in individual human lives, and in the history of civilization, and 
            finds the same core stages 
            the nature of reality, it makes more sense to focus on how exactly a perspective

                and is only ever partially correct about anything, and there is a collective, intersubjective 
                consensus which serves to mediate between the two. The individual was never "wrong." They
                were correct based on all the information available to their perspective. That is why 
                they hate being told they're wrong so much. They were certainly correct before you came along
