        <h1>Integral Theory</h1>
        <h3>Stein unLimited is a Second Tier Turquoise enterprise.</h3>
        <h3>What is the starting point of your beliefs?</h3>
        <p>Why do you know what you know? 
        If we consider this carefully, and include as much as possible but 
        keep it simple, we see that reality, as we experience it right now, 
        is constructed of multiple overlapping perspectives that flex and flow. 
        </p>
        <h3>Reality always includes consciousness. <br>It never doesn't. <br>That's what reality is.
        </h3>
        <p>One thing that might be seen as revolutionary about this perspective is that it includes You. While we tend to 
            explain reality in terms of the physical, here You are. There is
            no reality in which your personality, your drives and desires and knowledge and dreams and feelings, are 
            unreal or nonexistant. Quite the contrary, what we experience is entirely
            driven by the story we tell ourselves.
        </p>
        <h3>This is a sneaky thing Second Tier does.<br> 
            This is not fact or opinion. It's patterns. 
        </h3>
        <p>Your philosophy results from the way that
            you relate to facts and opinions in the first place. What we think, feel, and do 
            is a programmed response, an instance of a memetic archetype, a retelling of an old 
            story which may or may not still serve a function.</p>
        <p>To be free of these patterns is to get better at seeing them.<br>
            We have a sophisticated map (kind of the only one). 
        </p>
        <h3>We offer no ideology. <br>
            Only containers.</h3>
        <p>Integral is a framework.</p>
        <p>We focus on core patterns that 
            inter-relate facts, opinions, perspectives, circumstances, and outcomes. 
            We are meta-philosophical, 
            mapping the paradigms which govern our comprehension of reality.
        </p>
        <h4>If we start talking applications, we start to pigeon hole
            ourselves rather quickly.</h4>
        <p>
            This model applies to all of reality.
            It applies very directly to philosophy, history, the humanities, and comparative religion.
            Already, that's too much. It also applies to spiritual mysticism, psychology, and self help
            topics. So, that's half of the book store. It very directly applies to politics, 
            social topics, technology, arts and pop culture. I mean, that's the whole store.
            It's as useful in the workplace as the gym, on a date night or a quiet getaway.
            So is it a valid basis upon which to form a lifestyle, a community, a business? 
            <!-- I've been around a while, and I say it is. So, let's try it and see. -->
        </p>
        <h4>                
            It should be noted that elements of this model, according to its own logic,
            are unpalatable to humanity in the present day. 
        </h4>
        <p>In particular, we assert a great deal of human choice and 
            personal responsibility. We have a fundamentally optimistic view of life.
            We are idealistic and conscientious.</p>
        <p>People are uncomfortable with transcendental enlightenment concepts, as 
            these are associated with death, cultism, and loss of selfhood.
            Further, they tend to be confused on all sides with religious and magical notions.
        </p>
        <p> 
            The Integral network is small and self-selecting, as it is rare to 
            possess a firm grounding in shrewd skepticism, interdisciplinary expertise, and cultural deconstruction, 
            but also have experience with meditative spiritual practices that result in radically 
            altered states of consciousness and transformations to the comprehension 
            of the meaning of life and the nature of self. 
        </p>
        <p>Most philosophies accept hidden assumptions: that truth must conform to the
            known, to the perceived and acknowledged, to my prejudices and biases. These 
            stages of consciousness are categorized as First Tier. They lack 
            self-awareness of their internal consistency as memes, of the transparent 
            sources of their claims to truth, and of the historical 
            revisions to those memes into higher stages.
        </p>
        <h4>
        First Tier paradigms are subconscious values, 
        beliefs, and worldviews with hidden assumptions.
        </h4>
        <h4>Second Tier 
            stages of consciousness are characterized by an apparent comprehension 
            that reality 
            is dictated by personal and collective paradigms.</h4>
        <p>Second Tier reflects a capacity to define a starting point, 
            to model and describe human development from prior to being conscious, 
            to the stages representated by the population of Earth, to the 
            healthy Second Tier agent, which is extraordinarily rare.

            Stein unLimited is proud to provide materials 
            outlining Ken Wilber's Integral Theory, and to 
            promote Second Tier motives, attitudes, approaches, and causes.
            This system is considered open-ended and extensible.
