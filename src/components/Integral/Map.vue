        <h1>Modeling Everything</h1>
        <h3>Imagine trying to explain all of reality in a very small space üòú</h3>
        <!-- <h2>The 5 Modules</h2> -->
        <h3>1 Quadrants</h3>
        <p>The way that we conjugate language says a lot about how we perceive reality. Reality can be 
            described as an "I", a "We", an "It", or a system of "Its". What is real? I: this experience you're 
            having right now? We: all the 
            experiences of all people are real? It: this room I'm in right now is real? Its:, the universe that generates
            this room and me is real? The Four Quadrants illustrate
            how a singular "holonic" source unfolds in and expresses all four dimensions simultaneously, rendering all 
            four quadrants equally and entirely real. A holon, reflexively, is anything that expresses in all four Quadrants 
            - and since reality is the four Quadrants, this means that everything real exists in all four Quadrants and is 
            a holon. Everything not real, by any standard, exists in some Quadrants, but not all. 
            <!-- People understand reality to be the <b>interior subjective</b> experience of "I",
            in relation to an <b>external objective</b> reality "It". A human is both a physical body with 
            a brain emitting waves,
            and the ongoing story of a self having awareness, thoughts, friends and enemies, and dreams. These can be considered 
            the "two sides" of reality, or interior and exterior dimensions. Reality is the interaction between them.
            
            The "It" realm is composed
            of systems and groups of "Its." A human is both an individual, and a member
            of <b>collective external</b> civilization. Both are correct. Every human is an example of a human, and this is true
            of everything. Instances are produced by systems, and arise as groups. No person 
            could exist without the civilization that produced and raised them. Returning to the 
            internal, we recognize that nearly everything we know was taught to us. We speak, and 
            think, in a language that we learned as toddlers. There is also a "we" nature to reality, 
            for example, consider the difference between what "I" know and what I can look up on the 
            internet. The knowledge, thoughts, opinions, perspectives of others is a large part of reality 
            for everyone, and so we consider this the <b>collective internal</b> part of reality, the "we." -->

        <h3>5 States</h3>

        <p>If there is some existing reality, some objective factual truth, then really, 
            we are limited from knowing only by our awareness. Being human 
            imposes enormous limits on what we can know about reality. 
            
            There are probably aspects 
            of reality that a human cannot know, and so, our knowledge of reality can only ever be 
            an expanding work in progress. Rather than speculate on the nature of that great, given, 
            objectively factual pure reality, the Integral model traces the developmental course 
            of human thinking, both in individual human lives, and in the history of civilization, and 
            finds the same core stages 
            the nature of reality, it makes more sense to focus on how exactly a perspective 
            may be limited.

        <h3>The Integral Map</h3>
        <!-- <h3>Is it possible to be wrong?</h3>
        <p>In common speech, we say, "you're wrong," all the time. We don't mean to say that the 
            person themself is intrinsically wrong, we mean to say that an idea in their mind does 
            not match with our consensus about objective reality.  -->

            <!-- This example, and numerous others,
            point out that the way we understand reality is that there is an objective reality which 
            is true but unknown, and there is a subjective reality which differs from person to person 
            and is only ever partially correct about anything, and there is a collective, intersubjective 
            consensus which serves to mediate between the two. The individual was never "wrong." They
            were correct based on all the information available to their perspective. That is why 
            they hate being told they're wrong so much. They were certainly correct before you came along
            with your collective consensus truth. That consensus itself is partially wrong, 
            and will develop.   -->
        <!-- <p>And let us just hypothesize, for the moment, that this everyday observation about 
            how people comprehend reality might actually apply to philosophy. A person's 
            philosophy tells them what they think reality is, and they get this from the 
            collective cultural history of philosophy. 
        </p> -->
        <!-- <p>
            You can misrepresent, but how can you believe something that is not correct?

        adapted from the theory, work, and visuals of author Ken Wilber.

        <h1>Integral Theory</h1>
        <p>Integral Theory is a vast topic, and author Ken Wilber has an outstanding career 
            writing excellent and accessible books covering the skeleton
            and broad strokes of a mind-expanding approach to 
            thinking which exposes the system of thought of thinking itself.
            Presenting a meta-theory that is relevant to everyone and includes all fields, all realities, all 
            perspectives, where do you even begin?
        </p>
        <h3>üçÄ Luckily, the work has been done.</h3>
        <p>Stein unLimited presents a system of visual maps which orient your perspective 
            to the generalizations which, if properly understood, encapsulate and express 
            Integral. These are not original creations.
            They are closely adapted from Wilber's diagrams. We consider these universalizing truths, and we
            are proud to use the terms of the leading expert, as we express 
            Integral in our own voice. We hope that promoting and teaching Integral is received 
            with a blessing. We consider it a blessing ü´∂üèø. We consider this work important.
        </p> 

        <h3>Stein unLimited is a Second Tier Turquoise enterprise.</h3>
        <h3>What is the starting point of your beliefs?</h3>
        <p>Why do you know what you know? 
        If we consider this carefully, and include as much as possible but 
        keep it simple, we see that reality, as we experience it right now, 
        is constructed of multiple overlapping perspectives that flex and flow. 
        </p>
        <h3>Reality always includes consciousness. <br>It never doesn't. <br>That's what reality is.
        </h3>
        <p>One thing that might be seen as revolutionary about this perspective is that it includes You. While we tend to 
            explain reality in terms of the physical, here You are. There is
            no reality in which your personality, your drives and desires and knowledge and dreams and feelings, are 
            unreal or nonexistant. Quite the contrary, what we experience is entirely
            driven by the story we tell ourselves.
        </p>
        <h3>This is a sneaky thing Second Tier does.<br> 
            This is not fact or opinion. It's patterns. 
        </h3>
        <p>Your philosophy results from the way that
            you relate to facts and opinions in the first place. What we think, feel, and do 
            is a programmed response, an instance of a memetic archetype, a retelling of an old 
            story which may or may not still serve a function.</p>
        <p>To be free of these patterns is to get better at seeing them.<br>
            We have a sophisticated map (kind of the only one). 
        </p>
        <h3>We offer no ideology. <br>
            Only containers.</h3>
        <p>Integral is a framework.</p>
        <p>We focus on core patterns that 
            inter-relate facts, opinions, perspectives, circumstances, and outcomes. 
            We are meta-philosophical, 
            mapping the paradigms which govern our comprehension of reality.
        </p>
        <h4>If we start talking applications, we start to pigeon hole
            ourselves rather quickly.</h4>
        <p>
            This model applies to all of reality.
            It applies very directly to philosophy, history, the humanities, and comparative religion.
            Already, that's too much. It also applies to spiritual mysticism, psychology, and self help
            topics. So, that's half of the book store. It very directly applies to politics, 
            social topics, technology, arts and pop culture. I mean, that's the whole store.
            It's as useful in the workplace as the gym, on a date night or a quiet getaway.
            So is it a valid basis upon which to form a lifestyle, a community, a business? 
            <!-- I've been around a while, and I say it is. So, let's try it and see. -->
        </p>
        <h4>                
            It should be noted that elements of this model, according to its own logic,
            are unpalatable to humanity in the present day. 
        </h4>
        <p>In particular, we assert a great deal of human choice and 
            personal responsibility. We have a fundamentally optimistic view of life.
            We are idealistic and conscientious.</p>
        <p>People are uncomfortable with transcendental enlightenment concepts, as 
            these are associated with death, cultism, and loss of selfhood.
            Further, they tend to be confused on all sides with religious and magical notions.
        </p>
        <p> 
            The Integral network is small and self-selecting, as it is rare to 
            possess a firm grounding in shrewd skepticism, interdisciplinary expertise, and cultural deconstruction, 
            but also have experience with meditative spiritual practices that result in radically 
            altered states of consciousness and transformations to the comprehension 
            of the meaning of life and the nature of self. 
        </p>
        <p>Most philosophies accept hidden assumptions: that truth must conform to the
            known, to the perceived and acknowledged, to my prejudices and biases. These 
            stages of consciousness are categorized as First Tier. They lack 
            self-awareness of their internal consistency as memes, of the transparent 
            sources of their claims to truth, and of the historical 
            revisions to those memes into higher stages.
        </p>
        <h4>
        First Tier paradigms are subconscious values, 
        beliefs, and worldviews with hidden assumptions.
        </h4>
        <h4>Second Tier 
            stages of consciousness are characterized by an apparent comprehension 
            that reality 
            is dictated by personal and collective paradigms.</h4>
        <p>Second Tier reflects a capacity to define a starting point, 
            to model and describe human development from prior to being conscious, 
            to the stages representated by the population of Earth, to the 
            healthy Second Tier agent, which is extraordinarily rare.
