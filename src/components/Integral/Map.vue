        <h3>The Nature of Integral Theory (what is this?)</h3>
        <p>
            This is not trademarked guru secrets, but a free map of extremely popular, accepted, and well-known ideas. They 
            make no falsifiable, ontological claims, other than suggesting a categorization framework. 
            This is not an ideology. There is no belief. There is no guru. There is hardly any social movement. 
            It's just an extremely useful categorization schema for humans today, quite commonsense. We prefer 
            to use Integral, in the absense of alternatives.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Like the profound works of Freud, Jung, Einstein, Neitzche, and Marx, this should best be considered 
            exploratory, adapatable, incomplete, open-ended, and interpretive. 
            It is not pop psychology, nor is it new age 
            spiritualism or occultism. It is not pseudo-science. It just isn't science. It's not religion, though 
            it includes <em>all of these</em>, as it is a complete philosophy of reality and consciousness. 
            The colorful little words in the diagram can be thought of as "lenses," 
            or primary factors generating the reality that we experience,
            and the structural dynamics of the kosmos.
        </p>            
        <h2>Second Tier Reality</h2>
        <p>
        Integral 
        Theory is a tentatively complete philosophical system, so Integral synonymously 
        refers to Wilber's work, any similar methodology, as well 
        as any expression of the integral Level. Pretty much anything can be Integral.
        A <a href="https://www.stuartdavis.com/blog/creating-language" style="display: inline; text-decoration: none; color: teal;" target="_blank">language</a> 
        can be Integral. Even 
        a <a href="/time" target="_blank" style="display: inline; text-decoration: none; color: teal;">clock</a> can be Integral.
        </p>
        <p>
            The complicated AQALALATAS diagram attempts to encapsulate and 
        define an Integral, or Second Tier, perspective, which is the 
        most advanced <b>Level</b> of consciousness recognized today
        by a general survey of developmental psychology literature focusing on overall 
        stage trends. And there it is, the Teal map of reality, totally naked and complicated
        because that's how Teal likes to do things.  
        Are you as excited as I am? 😃

        <h1>Integral Theory</h1>
        <p>Author Ken Wilber has 
            made a career out of writing sophisticated and accessible books covering the 
            vast reaches of this mind-expanding approach to philosophy, and continues in advanced age to appear 
            in various podcasts and talks, continuing to develop new ways of expressing these ideas. His various institutes
            and academic programs offer superior resources. Stein unLimited has found this theory
            so useful, helpful, profound, and unnoticed, that a large part of our mission is 
            teaching these ideas in our own way, because we felt like it would be cool of us. 
        </p>
        <h3>Integral Thinking</h3>       
        <p>Integral is not just the presentation of these concepts, or even usage of them, it is properly 
            the process of arriving at them. This is not the place for a biography of Ken Wilber, but he arrived 
            somewhat decisively at a basic integral theory through intense research, spiritual practice, and an 
            exhaustive process of trying to organize all existing and accepted or just influential fundamental notions 
            of philosophy. 
        </p>
        <h3>The Ken Wilber Process</h3>
        <p>
            In the case of developmental psychology, this was achieved by laying out all existing models (some 
            interpretation necessary) and observing that they all trace different aspects of a person, and for different 
            purposes, but the overlap is unmistakable. The overlap itself generates a stage model, which is Altitudes.
            And then you see that the Altitudes not only apply to individuals, the same general patterns characterize 
            civilization, history, the way society is structured, everything everyone creates, everything everyone does,
            the reasons that we do what we do, and the relative nature of our own current perspective in the grand scope 
            of available perspectives.   

        </p>
        <p>
            side by side, and organizing 
            them logically. Truly novel individual progress is unlikely
            vis a vis the greatest and most earnest thinkers who ever lived. Wilber 
            organized his own research on consciousness, reality, and the mind, into the Five 
            Modules (AQALALATAS). As we return to the more ordinary deductive, social, and procedural 
            realities that we mostly face, we now have a map of the infinite 
            possibilities and perspectives available at all times.
        </p>

        <h3>What Does the Word Integral Actually Mean?</h3>
        <p>Commonly, integral indicates something is an important part
            or necessary aspect of a whole. Integral Theory asks, what are the important parts or
            necessary aspects of reality? What are the important parts or necessary aspects of 
            answering that question, about anything? How can I tell whether anyone can answer 
            that question? Relationships between whole and part characterize the 
            entire conceptual mechanic and operational fulcrum of the theory (as explored in the 
            Quadrants section), which is why Wilber and notable others have converged on the 
            term Integral. 
        </p>
        <h3>Calculus</h3>
        <p>In mathematics, the integral is a sort of function which generalizes other 
            functions under consideration, enabling another level of insights and enhanced calculation potential. 
            As with Integral Theory, generalizing here does not so much suggest omitting detail or diversity, 
            but more suggests including the abstraction of commonality 
            and trends from a transcendent meta or collective perspective. This sort of inductive meta-path
            yields archetypal patterns, dynamics, and mechanics which comprise an astoundingly 
            elegant and comprehensive model of reality. It includes the material universe, this experience, 
            consciousness, perspectives, the unconscious, and the unknown. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Physics and A Theory of Everything</h3>
        <p>
            There is a common 
            conception that fundamental particles, waves, or field concepts in physics, as the building 
            blocks, or structural essence, of reality, perhaps even the thoughts of God,  
            should reveal everything we need to know about the nature of reality. 
            "Theory of Everything" historically refers to a theory uniting relativity and 
            quantum mechanics. This is a conservative appraisal of "everything". Since Integral Theory
            includes material reality as the Right Quadrants and Levels beneath 
            Altitudes, and also 
            includes consciousness and culture, 
            which are real but do not have mass, charge, volume, or 
            spin, Integral is a better contender for Theory of Everything, if anyone still cares.
        </p>
        <h3>Integral Particle Physics</h3>
        <p>
            <!-- And not talking about spacial dimensions, but Quadrants.   -->
            Reality is not merely a massive heap of protons, neutrinos, leptons, etc., but those 
            particles stack and organize at various Levels, atoms, molecules, cells, tissues, and 
            each Level has unique dynamics and 
            mechanics, all flexing and flowing operationally with one another, moving together. The nature of  
            particles is of great interest to technology and philosophy. At every scale 
            of size, the "building blocks" of that Level have their own novel, emergent structure 
            and dynamics. The cells of my body each do their own thing, they all have their function, 
            but also they "integrate" into my body. We discovered cells, and 
            this opened up a new world of comprehending biology and medicine. We discovered 
            genetics. The derivative of cells, step down one Level, and you find that cells are integral 
            molecules. The periodic table yields the substance of reality. Of course, molecules are integral 
            atoms, are integral subatomic particles, are integral quarks. We'll find reality, 👍🏿 just keep digging.
        </p>
        <h3>A Thing Made Out Of Things That Makes A Thing</h3>
        <p> 
            It's okay to talk about physics. 
            Material reality is composed of Levels of holons, or whole entities which are whole unto themselves, but exist as 
            a part of another entity, as far up and as far down as we have ever been able to see. These are holons, 
            because whole atoms are parts of whole molecules, which are parts of whole cells. 
        </p>
        <h3>The Most Interesting Thing Anywhere</h3>
        <p>
            And I see you looking up towards the top of the stack of atoms and molecules and thinking, what's the top Level? Is it the Universe?
            The Meta-Versity? An embryo floating in space? Closer. You see, the Universe is very very big, 
            and so I see how, after looking at very very small, you might think the other extreme. What is the Universe?
            It's not a bunch of this, far as we know. There's not a bunch of people in it. Nah, it's pretty much just tons and 
            tons of lower Levels: particles, waves, molecules. These low Levels take up all of the physical 
            space in the Universe. Low Levels exist everywhere, with extreme amounts of space between them, and 
            they collectively form galaxies, stars, and planets. The very little compose the very big, not intelligent or 
            self-aware or alive, just big, relatively empty. It's very impressive, very 
            vast, and as far as we know, there is nothing out there, in any of that, doing what's going on right here.
            It's you, my love. You are a higher Level than the galaxy. Molecules and stars aren't alive.  
        </p>
        <h3>Middle Way ftw</h3>
        <p>Big and small are elusive frontiers, but normal-sized, or every-sized, is where you'll find 
            higher Levels. Because, 
            look at reality right now. The atoms, the molecules, they are being you and this environment, aren't they, and they are being 
            experienced because You are here. Now, this is very relevant to you, being at your scale. You, too, are a holon.
            When I say You, what do I mean? I mean a concept (meme) that your body (brain(chemisty(waves))) generates. That self concept 
            is a holon which could potentially form a higher self concept holon by integrating with other holons, but it is itself 
            made of holons 
            made of holons made of holons until you get to instinct, and here we see that over the natural history on Earth,
            life itself underwent a sort of memetic transformation, or evolution, or we can say phylogeny. 
        </p>
        <h3>The Entire Stack Is Evolving</h3>
        <p>
            Inevitably, the self concept must have arisen from instinct. What is 
            this thing we call instinct? It must be a form of consciousness that we share with the animals, but it 
            is a lower Level of consciousness, because they are not self aware. If we want to know how what instinct 
            is made of, or what it is, we can look at how it comes to be as a human sperm and egg transform into any old 
            human baby, or we can look at how our structure evolved biologically as we were shaped from the primate meme 
            from the mammal meme from the vertebrate meme from the animal meme from the life meme. 
            These memes have developed from the trial and error of reproduction and death, 
            but as you can see, the laboratory of life shows us, though it is abstract, that life evolves just like self 
            concepts, by integrating more primitive structural concepts into higher-Level structural concepts, because 
            higher Levels, though more fragile, offer enormous survival advantages under ideal conditions (higher Levels 
            are less stable and happen faster).
        </p>
        <h3>The Spectrum is One Process</h3>
        <p> 
            Oh boy, we're like, all 
            the way back now. To the microbial. This is the boundary where evolution goes from 
            biological to physical material. What's the difference in this case? <em>Exactly</em>. Where chemicals become life, 
            you find things very similar to the DNA creating our structures, and just like our self concept, and our knowledge 
            quest, the biological organisms have been adapting to their environment, but the DNA, as a collective, as itself 
            an evolutionary system,
            driven by the simple concrete reality of self-preservation to organize itself into more and more intelligent 
            creatures. Not on purpose, but just because it works better. Every Level of reality is implicated in evolutionary 
            processes, making evolution perhaps the primary dynamic of reality.
        </p>
        <p>
            All Levels of holons, possibly. You don't exist, except as holons. Cells form your tissues, like plants have. 
            These tissues form your organs, like animals have. Ah, so the higher Levels are life? Well, duh. So, then what, 
            grandpa. All right, all right, you settle down. One more and then it's off to sleepy land for you. There's Levels 
            of matter which, in some rare, very special circumstances, can form higher Level, transcendent things, called life.

        </p>
        <p>
            It is 
            more true to say your physical body is a stack of holonic Levels, than 
            to say that it is a collection of organs, a story of a woman named "Stevie," or the vibrations
            of eleventh dimensional super-strings. 
            These entities are so small that ideas of "seeing something happen" and "which direction it moved" stop 
            making the same kind of sense that they do in our personal scale of reality that we are familiar with.
            You can't look at light the same way you can look at something else, because light is the medium of vision.
            Everything you see is light. To look at light, you just look. There's no other way to do it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Science, philosophically, methodologically, can only rely on detected sense data. Thus, when we reach the 
            range of sense detection, we begin to use metaphors and mathematical models and talk like philosophers. Because 
            that which is outside of the range of science can only be comprehended through abstraction by a sensual being, 
            and that's all wonderful, I'm sure we'll make a super huge bomb. For some reason, we thought this would tell 
            us something about the meaning of life.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the way, I get that we're four dimensions of pointless heat 
            death falling, but where would I go if I wanted to understand the meaning of life? 
            Thus, the startling
            answer, if one can be derived from this, is <em>not</em> that one day, we will find 
            the tiniest thing that makes up everything but is utterly incomprehensible because it 
            exists in basically a different reality, but rather, our reality has always appeared to 
            consist of things which are made up of more basic things, and which themselves comprise 
            more complicated things. This is to say that reality is not constructed of particles; it 
            is holonic in nature. It is hard to say what advancements in quantum theory or 
            relativity may mean to the nature of reality. Surely something, probably startling 
            and amazing. However, what is already always available to see is that in all cases, reality 
            is holons. It is a developmental process unfolding over time, experienced as a relationship 
            between an individual consciousness existing within a collective, and an objective material
            reality composed of individual objects created by the individual and collective consciousness,
            as well as the holonic stacking nature of reality itself. This is the nature of reality 
            as understood by the "ordinary" State of consciousness, in which I am an ego trying to 
            persuade you that what I'm saying will fulfill your ambitions in order to fulfill my ambitions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Integral thought does a very similar move, 
            charting a system of generalizations that can be used as basic orientation 
            points across professional fields, cultures, and contexts.

            It means holistic and 
            inclusive, also often dialectical. 
            In a survey of psychological concepts and 
            models of consciousness, Wilber discovered that Integral was the 
            most commonly used term to describe a new stage of consciousness, typically the 
            final stage in these models. For discussion of the Integral stage, see the 
            Levels page. Importantly, Wilber's work is an attempt to create a sort of 
            philosophical groundwork, a manifesto, or just an introduction to the Integral 
            stage of consciousness, and so the word Integral will most likely forever be 
            nothing more than a reference to Ken Wilber. Whether or not the Integral stage 
            identifies itself by the word Integral, or whether Ken Wilber will ever be 
            recognized as a forefather of a massive global movement, for our purposes, it is 
            most important just to judge the plausibility of these stages, and observe that 
            the integral stage which exists in reality is mostly unaware of Wilber and Integral 
            Theory.

            The influential theoretical 
            advances of eastern mystic Sri Aurobindo also self-referred as Integral Yoga.

            <!-- and so didn't coin the term per se, certainly 
            his philosophy moves to identify as Integral as an expression of the philosophical 
            meta-meme, or meta-paradigm, of this emergent stage of human consciousness termed 
            Integral. -->

        <p>As a through-line, consider the question, "What is reality?"  
            Consider asking all the people you walk past, you work with, all the people you 
            know, all around the world, famous people all throughout history. <b>What's real?</b>
            How could you organize <em>all of that</em> into a simple expression of what is?
            And faced with each of these people, what would you say, if you had to explain it all?

        <!-- <h3>Sounds Impossible</h3>
        <p>
            But each day, we are expected 
            to go about life as though we are morally responsible for comprehending reality. 
            Are we? Can we articulate it in plain words? No. We avoid
            the topic of reality, because when we communicate openly, we fight.
            When you say impossible, I hear possible.  
            It gets personal, political, religious - hey! 
            I'm just asking the most basic question there is. It's for a friend.

            notice I wasn't asking, "What does everyone in the world think?" I asked, "What is the nature of 
            reality?" Not... 😡 big dense books. This. Reality. What is it? Why would AI not know what

        <h3>The Mental Prison's Blueprints</h3>
        <p>
            The Integral framework is a global put-in point, a most-zoomed-out view possible: 
            an entire map of reality as understood by humans. It tells you not only what 
            you already know, but what else there is. It's not the content of 
            who you are or what you think, it's just an optimized set of containers. The containers 
            are not traps, they are developmental opportunities with apparent growth vectors.
            <!-- With this 
            basic interface, this orientation, you can be sure to include some 
            reference to every existing aspect of reality, including parts you're not familiar with,
            and not give a partial, reductionistic, or self-excusing answer. -->

        <h3>A Fingerprint of Wisdom</h3>
        <p>In each Module, we explore a core pattern 
            of nature and mind, and this may be considered "spiritual," as it 
            pertains to topics that are termed that way. We gladly embrace and re-own this term,
            but with the note that this comes from a place of utmost empirical skepticism
            towards belief systems. The Integral spirituality is not magic and 
            myth, and requires no faith. For those who are spiritual, we hope that Integral will 
            help to lend context and conceptual support to your experiences and beliefs. We as a 
            brand consciously own and embrace our own versions of magic and myth, and find them to 
            be healthy and valuable within their domain. The majority of what is considered spiritual 
            in this context pertains to permanent changes to a person's regular brain functioning and felt
            sense of reality and identity, usually as the result of meditative practices.
            These practices are typically discovered within and best upheld by the religious traditions.  
        </p>
        <h3>Hey, This Is Like Some Other Thing...</h3>
        <p>
            It is the other thing. The Five Modules are entirely
            matter-of-fact observations and concepts we use 
            intuitively in today's world. Insights pertaining to spirituality apply equally to all religious, 
            spiritual, and atheist or agnostic perspectives. Wilber's work is a grand synthesis; practically no 
            aspect of it is entirely original, and nearly everything
            represented in this model derives from the overlap of numerous credited sources which might or might not
            find Integral Theory agreeable. What is unique and creative to Wilber's work is his selection, curation, and framing 
            of these academic, literary, and esoteric sources,
            the way he organizes and categorizes them, and the scope of the entire articulated vision. 
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
            For most people, Quadrants, Levels, and States are intuitive 
            and familiar, but we generally have not seen them stated in this way.
            Types and Lines are considered more in the domain of conventional psychology and 
            social sciences. What Integral contributes to those is mostly the inclusion of 
            the others. We consider Lines and Types helpful but somewhat incomplete, as contemporary approaches
            (DSM-V classification, Myers-Briggs, Piaget cognitive levels, enneagram, Astrology, Hawkins scale...) attempt to exist
            as isolated systems and classify some aspects of consciousness without regard for others. 
        </p> -->
        <h3>How does all of this relate to the Map?</h3>
        <p>All of what is being conveyed here, Integral Theory and all, is Level 7, typical Teal Meme. It couldn't 
            be more on the nose. The 
            message of a Second Tier culture is a genuine, personal call to Wake Up, Grow Up, and Clean Up. 
            Spirituality, Development, and Integrity. It is a call to Transcend and Include - to take a step back 
            into abstraction and hold the apparent as sacred treasure.

            is a partial view. In order to describe the way that humans understand the nature of reality,
            I had to explain the Quadrants.

        <!--    
        <h3>It really isn't a weird new age cult thing?</h3>
        <p>Here is the deal. We have a map of reality. According to the map, human 
            individuals and human civilization, at the second, third, and fourth Levels,
            or stages, comprehend reality to be magical and mythical, they use symbols and 
            stories as their lens. Some of them are us, when we express those stages, those 
            capacities which of course do exist within us. They are familiar, having existed 
            throughout recorded history, banding together 
            into tribes of belief in magic and myth. The fifth Level developed out of mythical
            culture, and introduced an Orange lens, or meme, that said that the nature of reality 
            has to be factually proven by an expert, everyone can find their own truth, we'll 
            engineer our world and govern ourselves. There's no such thing as myth or magic.
            Integral is not here to say which of these perspectives is "reality," but rather to 
            say that in the mind of individuals, and in society and culture, magic is a low stage 
            of comprehension, myth is a middle stage of comprehension, rationality is a higher stage.
            Rationality is globally agreeable, while myth is regional and often racial. To put it 
            bluntly, a cult or religion of Integral is even less likely than the Church of the Spaghetti
            Monster and Subgenius of stages 5 and 6. They are respectively a proof of absurdity and 
            an ironic influencer stunt. In any case, the social model of cults and religions applies to 
            the lowest stages, considered as far from Second Tier as possible. That must be clear.
        </p>
        <h3>Naming the wrungs of the evolutionary ladder.</h3>
        <p>
            The culture appearing before us today includes some magic and myth. The main currents 
            of it are Level 5 rationality and Level 6 Green Meme internet and social media culture 
            of influence, sensitivity, and inclusion. We live in a rational world, deconstructing 
            itself and often succumbing to its own worst impulses. If you see that all of this is 
            happening and want to help do something about it, then you are Level 7 Teal in terms 
            of your motives.
        </p>
        <p>Integral is not an attempt to legitimize mystical, religious,
            or spiritual thinking. It just happens that these are extremely common, and we might 
            say, pyschologically healthy and sociologically natural, ways of thinking - more 
            natural and more historically normal by far than rational or science-based thinking. 
            
        </p>
        <p>Another thing happens at Level 7. We see that Levels exist, and there are more than 7. We 
            are about in the middle, here.

        <p>If there is some existing reality, some objective factual truth, then really,

            of reality that a human cannot know, and so, our knowledge of reality can only ever be 
            an expanding work in progress. Rather than speculate on the nature of that great, given, 
            objectively factual pure reality, the Integral model traces the developmental course 
            of human thinking, both in individual human lives, and in the history of civilization, and

                and is only ever partially correct about anything, and there is a collective, intersubjective

                were correct based on all the information available to their perspective. That is why
